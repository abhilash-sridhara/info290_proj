It sometimes seems as though Donald Trump is to business what the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas is to Venice -- a fun, cheesy caricature of the real thing.
One would not necessarily want the real estate developer known as the Donald to represent American capitalism, but he is perfectly cast as the hammy boss on NBC's rat-race reality show, ''The Apprentice.''
The premise, for anyone who has missed the blaring promos on television and in movie theaters, is urban ''Survivor'' -- 16 young would-be entrepreneurs compete at an array of business tasks (the first assignment is to sell lemonade on the street). The last one standing will become president of one of Mr. Trump's companies for a year. Each week, one aspirant is eliminated -- not voted off by his rivals, as is the case on other shows, but by Mr. Trump, who presses the losers to turn on their weakest link before delivering judgment (''You're fired!'').
January is crammed with fresh contortions on the reality genre, from Fox's ''My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé'' (a woman has to pass off a horrible boor as the love of her life to family and friends) to ''Can You Be a Pornstar?'' a self-explanatory reality show on adult pay-per-view cable channels. But ''The Apprentice'' stands out as one that takes a modest twist on the ''Survivor'' formula -- from jungle to urban jungle -- and improves on it.
There is more to ''The Apprentice'' than just the spectacle of Type A contestants making fools of themselves or the irresistible braggadocio and banality of Mr. Trump. (''New York,'' he says in a typical voice-over narration. ''It can chew you up and spit you out.'').
There are some intriguing glimpses of reality behind the television reality.
As on any of these shows, clichés and stereotypes are tweaked and teased for the camera: Jessie, 21, the chiropractor/real estate agent from Wisconsin, delivers her biography posed next to bales of hay. Ereka, 27, the marketing manager who grew up in New York, shows off her big-city smarts by showing up the first day at work at the Trump headquarters in a strapless top.
The women are teamed against the men, who run a gamut from Kwame, 29, an African-American Wall Street investment manager with an M.B.A. from Harvard, to Troy, 32, who never went to college and is a mortgage lender/real estate developer in Idaho. As was the case when men were pitted against women in ''Survivor: The Amazon'' (Mark Burnett, the creator of ''Survivor,'' is the executive producer of ''The Apprentice''), the men start out like Eagle Scouts, calmly setting goals and divvying up chores, while the women debate, bicker and even cry -- at times, they fall back on feminine wiles to get ahead.
Yet in between those stock tableaus are smaller, truer life lessons: early in the first episode, each team has to select a name. The women, hardwired to listen and to please, come up with the Protégé Corporation. The men, missing even Mr. Trump's most glaring cues for flattery, call themselves the Versa Corporation.
''That's a pretty interesting choice,'' Mr. Trump mutters with complete uninterest.
When the teams are summoned to the New York Stock Exchange, it is the men who fret over what to wear. ''It would not be inappropriate to wear a tie,'' David, 31, a doctor/venture capitalist, suggests gravely.
A personality clash between Ereka and Omarosa, 29, a political consultant/pageant coach and the only African-American woman competing on the show, festers into a racial standoff in the second episode. Those are the ragged, unpleasant frictions that made reality shows like MTV's ''Real World'' and CBS's ''Survivor'' so popular in the first place; they have been airbrushed out of the more contrived dating shows like ''The Bachelor.''
In the through-the-looking-glass morality of reality shows, the quest for money is more honorable than the pursuit of love, which as almost every variation on ''The Bachelor'' has shown, is actually a grab for fame and fortune dressed up as romance. Viewers may doubt the sincerity of Larissa on ''Average Joe Hawaii,'' but it is hard to question Omorosa's determination to finish first.
And for once, the players' personalities are not revealed by how well they balance a tiki torch or pitch woo in a hot-air balloon. Each week, the teams are thrown into into real work places -- next week, they compete to come up with the best advertising campaign for a company marketing corporate jet service. (Viewers may be surprised to learn that even top New York advertising executives still say things like ''Think outside the box.'' )
Mostly, ''The Apprentice,'' is about career voyeurism -- the kind of fantasy fulfillment that George Plimpton used to indulge in by playing quarterback with the Detroit Lions or filling in for the percussionist of the New York Philharmonic.
And then of course, there is Mr. Trump, sweeping in and out in his black Trump helicopter like Glinda the Rich Witch. Perhaps not surprisingly from a man whose biography on the show's Web site is longer than those of Frankin D. Roosevelt and Bill Gates combined, a top reward for a job well done was a peek at his private penthouse apartment.
The best that one can say for that opulent sprawl of pink marble, gold and crystal is that it does indeed reflect its owner's taste. And there was something wonderfully ambivalent in the stunned reaction of one contestant. ''You have to want those things, you have to aspire to those things,'' the would-be apprentice said pensively, ''if you want to be like Trump.''

TELEVISION REVIEW
Correction:  March 25, 2006, Saturday  An article in The Arts on March 13 about Tony DiSanto, executive vice president for series development and animation at MTV Networks, misstated the role of Mark Burnett, one of the ''reality auteurs'' to whom a media professor compared him. (Similar errors occurred in more than a dozen earlier articles, dating to July 2001.) Mr. Burnett is an executive producer of ''Survivor,'' not the creator. Charlie Parsons, another executive producer of ''Survivor,'' created the format, initially for a Swedish show, on which it is based.
	Howard Dean went on television to atone for what he did on television.
He did so by speaking steadily and smilingly to Diane Sawyer last night on ABC's ''Primetime Thursday,'' with his arm wrapped protectively around his wife, Judith.
When Ms. Sawyer asked the candidate if his ferocious, almost maniacal concession speech in Iowa on Monday looked unpresidential, Mr. Dean replied, ''Well, I would certainly agree with that.''
From Richard M. Nixon's Checkers speech to Bill Clinton's ''60 Minutes'' interview about Gennifer Flowers, politicians have a history of going on television to quell accusations of misconduct. The interview the Deans gave on Thursday was a new kind of media brinksmanship: going on national television in a last-ditch effort to overturn what damaged him in the first place: national television.
If there is a precedent, it was in 1988, when Mr. Clinton went on ''The Tonight Show'' to make fun of himself after delivering a famously longwinded speech at the Democratic National Convention. (Delegates cheered when Mr. Clinton finally said, ''In closing.'') Back then, however, Mr. Clinton was not yet a presidential candidate and did not have much at immediate stake. Dr. Dean's predicament is far more dire.
And at times, it showed. As he began listing his faults, Dr. Dean stumbled over the words ''I wear cheap suits sometimes,'' which gave the impression he was reciting an adviser-vetted defense as he continued, ''I say things that I probably ought not to say, but I lead with my heart, and that's what I was doing right there, is leading with my heart.''
Dr. Dean said he had seen the Iowa tape only once, which if true, could make him the only person in America able to make that boast. Clips of him urging on his supporters have become the campaign equivalent of the video of Saddam Hussein's capture, a startling moment shown over and over on cable news programs and mocked mercilessly on the Internet and late-night comedy shows.
Television speeds up and amplifies political false steps, but it did not invent them. Senator Edmund S. Muskie lost his momentum and the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972 after he was reported to have grown tearful defending his wife's honor at a frigid outdoor news conference. That show of emotion undermined his image without the help of a clear television image or 24-hour cable news shows.
Dr. Dean was unabashed as he was taped watching a tape of his Iowa performance on a monitor.
''I was having a great time,'' he said almost affectionately. ''Look at me!''
Mrs. Dean looked as if she would rather not. She confessed to Ms. Sawyer that she rarely watched television and first saw the tape of her husband's speech on Wednesday.
''I thought it looked kind of silly,'' she said. ''But I thought it looked O.K.''
For others, Dr. Dean looked almost scary, bolstering inchoate worries about his self-control.
The candidate grew a bit flushed on Thursday when Ms. Sawyer confronted him with a barrage of apparent blowups, including signs of temper at his boarding school, St. George's, and he countered that she was seeking to ''make a case, as all the other campaigns would like to.''
His wife, who told Ms. Sawyer to call her Judy Dean (''I use Steinberg only in my office and the hospital''), wore a red sweater set and a friendly smile throughout the interview. She was there to attest to her husband's good temper and to address concerns about her absence from the campaign trail.
Until reporters began to write about it, Mrs. Dean stayed in Vermont, tending to her medical practice and the couple's teenage son.
The two doctors looked affectionate and comfortable with each other, and Dr. Dean kept his cool on camera, but the television interview format has lost some of its impact through overuse -- everyone from Michael Jackson to Linda Lay, wife of Kenneth L. Lay, the chief executive of the Enron Corporation, have resorted to intimate, semiconfessional television appearances when they are in trouble.
Mostly it was Mrs. Dean's unvarnished and at times impolitic candor that lent the interview a dash of sincerity.
''I love Howard, and I think he would make a terrific president,'' she said. ''And, I think if I can help him, I will. And that doesn't mean he's going to disrupt my life, disrupt my patients, my son, but if he calls on a Saturday, and I'm not on call that weekend, I'll be out there Sunday.''
THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: TV WATCH
	The tone of Air America was supposed to be as bold and belligerent as Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity, an unapologetically liberal riposte to the conservative radio talk shows that dominate the airwaves.
The comedian Al Franken even named his three-hour program the ''The O'Franken Report,'' to tweak his conservative nemesis, Bill O'Reilly, yet his maiden show proved to be oddly subdued and, at times, defensive.
Mr. Franken interviewed the salt-of-the-earth parents of his best friend in Minnesota to prove that liberals do not hate America, as the conservative commentator Ann Coulter has charged.
''That's unbelievable,'' Carol Griffin, 77, said of the accusation while on vacation in Florida. ''Liberals are the ones that love America. Honestly.''
There is little chance that Air America will overtake its conservative competitors any time soon. Rush Limbaugh is heard on more than 600 stations, including WABC in New York.
The Air America Radio network made its debut in five markets: New York; Chicago; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; and San Bernardino-Riverside, Calif.
Air America may yet grow as a radio network, but the first day mostly highlighted the difficulty of trying to match the fervor and ferocity of right-wing radio. Satire and sarcasm come more easily than rage to Mr. Franken, a former ''Saturday Night Live'' performer and writer. And rage -- unbound by reason or reticence -- is what fuels the most successful political talk shows.
Mr. Franken began his show by saying, ''Yeah, we are angry,'' but he never let loose with the kind of colorful, free-flowing rant that has proved so cathartic to like-minded listeners. (That sort of diatribe was provided later in the afternoon by the longtime liberal radio talk show host Randi Rhodes, who likened the Bushes to the Corleone family in ''The Godfather'' and said the president was Fredo.) Mr. Franken stuck instead to a middle ground of mockery and mild indignation.
The Bush administration's handling or mishandling of the war on terror after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was the main topic on all the shows on Air America, which began at noon with Mr. Franken's show and ended with ''Majority Report, '' with the actress Janeane Garofalo and Sam Seder as hosts.
Mr. Franken's guests included Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator from Nebraska who is now a member of the Sept. 11 commission, the documentary filmmaker Michael Moore and, as a caller from Tennessee, former Vice President Al Gore. (''Hi, Al,'' Mr. Franken said. ''Hi, Al,'' Mr Gore replied.)
Mr. Gore's call was one of the show's highlights. Mr. Moore, who supported Ralph Nader in the 2000 election, had a few words to say to the Democratic nominee who won the popular vote but still lost the election to George W. Bush.
''We're really sorry, Al,'' Mr. Moore mumbled. Mr. Gore paused for a beat, then asked, ''For what, Michael?'' Mr. Moore then began a long, winding explanation of how he himself had not campaigned for Mr. Nader in swing states. Mr. Gore again paused, then added politely, ''What are you saying?''
For the kickoff, Mr. Franken invited some of his more famous friends to make call-in cameos; Ben Stein, a former speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon, was one. The other was G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate fame. They did not bring great material with them.
Neither did Bob Elliott, who was the Bob of the old ''Bob & Ray Show,'' and was tapped by Mr. Franken to perform a skit about a terrorist sneaking weapons onto an airplane. In the skit, a would-be hijacker-terrorist explains that he made his dog swallow a box-cutter before takeoff, saying, ''He gets airsick, or so we hope.''
The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, referred to as Condi, came under attack, as did Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld (Mr. Franken does a very funny impersonation of Mr. Rumsfeld). But most of Mr. Franken's ire was directed at conservative commentators, including Mr. Limbaugh and his drug problems and the outrageous statements of Ms. Coulter, whom Mr. Franken described as a ''walking horror show.'' On the show, Mr. Franken pretended to lock an irate Ms. Coulter, impersonated by the actress Bebe Neuwirth, in the green room.
And clearly, it is conservative talk radio that galls Mr. Franken the most. ''The radical right wing has taken over the White House, Congress, and increasingly, the courts,'' he complained in his introductory remarks. ''And most insidiously, the airwaves.''
Critic's Notebook  Correction:  April 3, 2004, Saturday  A Critic's Notebook article on Thursday about the premiere of the liberal radio network Air America omitted the stations on which its programs are heard. They are WLIB-AM (1190) in New York, WNTD-AM (950) in Chicago, KBLA-AM (1580) in Los Angeles, KCAA-AM (1050) in Riverside and San Bernardino, Calif., KPOJ-AM (620) in Portland, Ore., and Channel 167 on XM Satellite Radio.
Correction:  April 6, 2004, Tuesday  A Critic's Notebook article on Thursday about the premiere of the liberal radio network Air America misstated the title given to Al Franken's program, as a parody of Bill O'Reilly's television program on Fox. It is ''The O'Franken Factor,'' not ''The O'Franken Report.''
