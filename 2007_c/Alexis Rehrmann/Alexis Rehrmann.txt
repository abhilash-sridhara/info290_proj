When Destiny-Rae was quiet at 18 months old, Delores Pryce knew that something was wrong. ''All my children talked early,'' she said. ''But she wasn't speaking.''
The problem, as Ms. Pryce discovered, was that her daughter could not hear. The fluid in her ears was not draining properly. An operation to install tubes to drain the fluid in each ear solved the hearing problem.
Today, as she turns 7 years old, Destiny-Rae is a chatty, bubbly first grader who likes to read. ''I read all kinds of books,'' she said.
Destiny-Rae's premature birth came with medical complications and a wrenching change of address that turned the lives of Ms. Pryce, now 43, and her family upside down.
In December 1999, Ms. Pryce was pregnant with Destiny-Rae and visiting New York with her three children, Misty-Lee, Keano-Ross and Marie-Chantal, then ages 3 through 10. She was on vacation from her native England after fleeing a tumultuous marriage. She had planned to return home shortly after the new year.
On Jan. 4, 2000, Destiny-Rae was born two months early. ''When she came out she was red and then, all of a sudden, she turned blue,'' Ms. Pryce remembered. ''She wasn't able to breathe.''
Destiny-Rae spent 16 days in the hospital and was released weighing little more than four pounds. Ms. Pryce was stranded in New York with four children, one of them a fragile newborn.
''The hospital wouldn't let me fly home,'' she said.
The family was staying with friends, but the arrangement soured, leaving the entire Pryce family homeless. Ms. Pryce gathered her children and entered a Brooklyn shelter.
Destiny-Rae was in and out of Kings County Hospital Center five times before her first birthday, for pneumonia and other complications. Ms. Pryce and her three children traveled by subway from their Brooklyn shelter to visit her daily. The family lived in a shelter during the next four years. Destiny-Rae had emotional and behavioral issues, including hyperactivity, a sensitivity to touch and a quick temper.
Then, in September 2004, Tabernacle Church in Jamaica, Queens, offered a lifeline. Ms. Pryce had been a member of the Baptist congregation for three years. The church offered her a small two-bedroom apartment above its small worship space and set the rent at $250 a month.
''It looked like a bomb hit it,'' Ms. Pryce said. ''We cleaned it up. We did our bit.'' The apartment today is furnished with worn, hand-me-down furniture. Amy and Patrick, the family parakeets, fly around the living room.
Destiny-Rae pointed to two paper certificates for perfect school attendance in October. ''This is Misty's perfect attendance; this is mine,'' she said.
Ms. Pryce lives here with Destiny-Rae and Misty-Lee, 10, who is in fifth grade. Her eldest daughter, 17, is in college in England, where students typically start college classes at 16. Her son, Keano-Ross, is living there with Ms. Pryce's parents and doing well in fourth grade.
The apartment was a huge step toward stability, but paying the electricity bill was a new hurdle.
''They sent me a bill when I first came here and I paid that bill,'' Ms. Pryce remembered.
Then, she said, Consolidated Edison sent no bills for months. The Con Ed office is across the street from Destiny-Rae's weekly play therapy, and Ms. Pryce said that she inquired there regularly about her bill. She was told that Con Ed did not have her account information. About a year and a half later, she received a $1,600 electricity bill.
The family income is limited to $626 a month from Destiny's Supplemental Security income and supplemented by $152 in food stamps, and a $20 stipend from the church food pantry, where Ms. Pryce also volunteers twice a week. She also picks up baby-sitting jobs, and works one day a week at a neighborhood grocery.
Ms. Pryce managed to pay $500 toward the electric bill. But in October, Con Ed threatened to remove the meter, and she asked for help to pay the remaining balance.
She turned to Keiko Aizawa, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children, which provides preventive services for families with medically fragile children. The program is run by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Ms. Aizawa, who has been involved with the family since Destiny-Rae's ear surgery more than five years ago, found money to pay off the remaining $1,100 on the electricity bill, $500 of which was Neediest Cases money.
''You guys came through for me. I'm not going back in the shelter,'' said Ms. Pryce, who is grateful for Ms. Aizawa's continued support.
Things are looking up. Destiny-Rae receives physical, occupational and speech therapy each week and is catching up academically. ''By the age of 8 or 9, she should be up to par and out of special ed,'' Ms. Aizawa said.
Ms. Pryce hopes to find a full-time job now that two of her girls are in school here, and she said that she is finally beginning to feel more secure.
''I've got the sense that I'm safe here,'' she said. ''Everything will be all right. They've got better as things have gone along.''
In her bedroom, Misty-Lee pulled out some princess decorations and pink paper wall hangings that Ms. Aizawa gave the girls a few months ago. ''We're going to put it up soon,'' she said.

Correction:  January 18, 2007, Thursday  An article on Jan. 4 about Delores Pryce, a Queens woman whose youngest daughter has health problems and who received help from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to help pay an electricity bill, referred incorrectly to New Alternatives for Children, a program that helps families with medically fragile children. (The error was repeated in an article on Jan. 5 about Dorcas Acheampong, a Bronx woman who received help from the fund to help pay her rent.) Although it is a member agency of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, it is not run by the federation.
	''I'm O.K.! I'm O.K.,'' Shenay Acheampong, 3, insisted, her little voice slightly croaky from a cold.
Shenay was born with osteogenesis imperfecta Type III, a genetic condition commonly called brittle bone disease.
''She's very fragile,'' said her mother, Dorcas Acheampong, 28. ''She break easily.'' Shenay is small, with short arms and legs. For her, the most mundane movement is risky; pulling off a snug shirt can snap a bone. Shenay has spent much of her young life in hospitals, where blood pressure cuffs, X-ray procedures and intravenous insertions have all caused breaks and fractures.
''Any time she goes to the hospital, we have to put a note in her crib,'' said Ms. Acheampong, who estimates that Shenay has worn 50 casts in her 3 years.
Shenay's delicate bones impose a severe limitation on her lively mind. She spends most of her days lying down, too weak to sit up for more than an hour. She looks up at the world with big, bright eyes. "Mentally, everything is O.K., her head, brain and everything," her mother said, and Shenay emphatically agreed.
''She always needs somebody to talk with because she likes to talk,'' Ms. Acheampong said.
''She has lots of opinions,'' added Keiko Aizawa, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children Inc. a preventive program that serves families with medically fragile children, including Ms. Acheampong and Shenay. The program is run by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Mother and daughter have spent a lot of time in hospitals. Treating Shenay's disease requires calcium infusions every three months. As an infant, it took her a month or more to recover from the infusions. Now it requires a three-day stay at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan.
When Shenay was 7 months old, in October 2003, she had brain surgery, and a shunt was inserted to allow fluid to drain. After the surgery, she had difficulty swallowing and was fed through a tube in her nose for two years, until last October, when a feeding tube was inserted in her stomach, which she prefers.
''It's hiding, so it's O.K.,'' her mother said. ''She didn't want people to ask questions about the tube.''
Ms. Acheampong was unable to work while caring for Shenay during her preparation for surgery to insert the new feeding tube and then her recovery from it. She fell behind on rent. Neediest Cases was able to help. Ms. Acheampong's monthly rent is $648 for her one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. She receives $606 in Supplemental Security Income for Shenay each month, and $140 in food stamps. Shenay's medical costs are covered by Medicaid. Ms. Aizawa put $300 of Neediest Cases money toward Ms. Acheampong's rent for December.
Ms. Acheampong had worked as a home health aide and is eager to return to work when her daughter's health allows. ''I had more experience taking care of her. So I can take any case they give me,'' she said.
Shenay is busy learning new things. She practices eating. ''She's trying to feed herself, but she can't do it like a normal baby,'' Ms. Acheampong said. ''She's weak.'' Twice a week Shenay has therapy: speech, physical, occupational and feeding.
At the end of November Shenay got a back and leg brace, which Ms. Acheampong and the doctors hope will give her the strength to stand and perhaps someday to walk. ''Right now they just want to start standing her up,'' Ms. Acheampong said.
Shenay started school in the fall at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Queens, which provides grade level work and access to medical care. She gets there on a school bus three days a week. Even school at a hospital can be hurtful. ''They want me to bring big clothes if I'm bringing her to St. Mary,'' Ms. Acheampong said, so the staff can change Shenay without injuring her.
Ms. Aizawa said that, at New Alternatives, Shenay and her mother have found help and a role model: a 20-year-old woman with the same disease who grew up in the program. ''She goes to Hunter College,'' Ms. Acheampong said. ''She lives in her own apartment. She's in a wheelchair, and she needs lots of help, but she is a very bright woman with a great talent for art.''
Ms. Acheampong said that she and the Hunter College student talk on the phone ''all the time.'' Ms. Acheampong is hopeful that Shenay will be independent. ''I'm hoping that she will be a bright person, a big person,'' she said.
But mostly, they focus on today.
''Mama, I'm itchy,'' Shenay piped.
''This is the big job we do every day: scratch her hair 24 hours,'' Ms. Acheampong said as she pulled her daughter close and gently scratched the back of her head. Shenay's arms are too short to do it.

	''Blood'' is spray painted over the front door of the apartment building where Patricia Barnes's family lives. It appears again and again on the walls of the stairwell leading to their second-floor apartment.
Ms. Barnes, 38, is raising two teenagers in the tough East New York neighborhood in Brooklyn, and she is doing everything she can to keep them off these streets.
About five years ago, she sent her four younger children, now ages 11 to 13, to live with their father's extended family in Ivory Coast, where she believed they would be safer.
''I think that is the best decision I made,'' said Ms. Barnes, who calls Ivory Coast to speak with her children two or three times a week. ''The way things are running around out here nowadays, I don't want them out here. I don't want him out here.''
By ''him,'' Ms. Barnes meant her son Raymond, 14, who is a high school freshman. Her daughter Chaka Ward, 17, who prefers to be called Tisha, is a sophomore.
Ms. Barnes said she began seeing worrisome changes in Raymond when he was in junior high school.
''He was doing pretty good in school, and then, I don't know,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''It's like he woke up and he just, 'I don't want to do it no more.' ''
Raymond agreed. ''I was a loose cannon,'' he said, adding that he was ''running wild.''
He was skipping school, outside at all hours, quick-tempered and willing to fight. Such behavior would be frustrating for any parent, but for Ms. Barnes, who sometimes hears gunfire from her window, it was frightening. She waited up for him at night. She worried that despite his youth, Raymond's height -- at 14 he is already 6-foot-3 -- might get him in adult-sized trouble.
''It felt like my whole world was crumbling,'' she said. ''I was losing control of him, and that's the one thing I felt should never, ever happen.''
Ms. Barnes took any help she could find, including a warning from Raymond's basketball coach that bad behavior would keep him on the bench.
''She slowed me down, started making me think,'' Raymond said about his coach. ''I really wanted to be on the team. So I started calming down, letting a lot of things slide.''
But Raymond's behavior did not change overnight. An altercation at school led to more absences, and in December 2005, Ms. Barnes applied for a Person In Need of Supervision petition. The petition would give Family Court the power to force Raymond to attend school.
Rather than grant the petition, the court referred the family for counseling at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
They began attending counseling sessions in February at the bureau's East New York Family Center. Ms. Barnes goes weekly, and Tisha and Raymond accompany her monthly.
After 10 months of counseling, changes are evident in Ms. Barnes's life. She is training for a new job and earned her G.E.D. last month.
Ms. Barnes had worked as a home health aide for years, but it was unstable income, and she relied on public assistance to make ends meet.
In October, Ms. Barnes started a job training program through public assistance. She works for the Parks Department, cleaning city parks. She describes the program as ''giving you your responsibility: to be a part of the working class,'' she said, ''which is a beautiful thing, because I love it.''
She earns about $320 a week and receives $115 in food stamps each month. Her share of the rent for her subsidized four-bedroom apartment is $150 a month. Her job training program ends in March, and she hopes to be hired permanently.
Ms. Barnes said she cherished the time she spent with her oldest children studying for the G.E.D. exam. Tisha helped her with language, and Raymond studied algebra with her.
''He actually took a genuine interest in it,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''It was so amazing for us to just lay across the bed and just talk about it.''
''I'm proud of my accomplishments,'' she said. ''Your kids have something to look up to.''
Cascille Andela, a social worker who counsels the family, said she had seen a big change in Ms. Barnes's ability to cope with adversity.
''She is able to come home and be more relaxed, understanding, and trying to work though problems rather than getting frustrated and throwing her hands up,'' Ms. Andela said.
After a home visit in which she noticed that Raymond and Ms. Barnes were both sleeping in the living room, Ms. Andela used $965 from the Neediest Cases to replace the family's worn mattresses.
''You've got to have a bed to sleep in,'' Ms. Andela said. ''You can't go to work the next morning if you can't get to sleep at night.''
Ms. Barnes hopes that her children will draw inspiration from her efforts. In December, Tisha started her first job, working at a day care center. ''I don't care where she worked as long as the little girl knows it's going to feel good to get a paycheck,'' Ms. Barnes said.
As for Raymond, he is getting in fewer fights, and is working at grade level for the first time after eight years in special education classes, where he had been placed because of his behavior. He grudgingly admits this year's schoolwork is a little more interesting. Ms. Barnes and Ms. Andela are still working on persuading him to attend school regularly, but he is no longer roaming the streets.
Bit by bit, Ms. Barnes and her family seem to be gaining ground.
''I've made it my business to not let anything stop me from achieving my goals,'' she said.
