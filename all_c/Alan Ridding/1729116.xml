        <p>On many Venetian evenings, Baroque music can be heard echoing from concerts in the city's myriad churches. In the 1750's, that same music also filled the air.

        <p>On many Venetian evenings, Baroque music can be heard echoing from concerts in the city's myriad churches. In the 1750's, that same music also filled the air. Or so it would appear from Lasse Hallstrom's new romantic comedy, ''Casanova,'' in which the infamous rake goes about his mischief accompanied by Vivaldi, Albinoni, Corelli and the like.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it might even be said that, along with Venice itself, Baroque music plays the libertine's accomplice here. And since ''Casanova'' is a period farce, it also seems logical for the score to embrace the humor and rhythms of opera buffa, as the 18th-century Italian comic opera was known.</p>
        <p>And yet Baroque music lovers may well be puzzled.</p>
        <p>They may recognize familiar passages, because almost all the music in ''Casanova'' has been taken from concertos, overtures and dances written by a dozen or so 18th-century composers. Yet, because the excerpts have been stitched together in an original -- and thoroughly cinematic -- way, they are actually hearing a ''new'' Baroque work.</p>
        <p>The movie, which opened Dec. 25 to warm reviews, stars Heath Ledger as Casanova and Sienna Miller as Francesca Bruni, the woman he finally loves forever. (This is fiction.) Also on board are Jeremy Irons, Lena Olin, Oliver Platt and Omid Djalili. And then, moving the plot along at a 007 pace, through duels, trials and chases, is the score.</p>
        <p>''It was just an obvious first idea to go with period music,'' Mr. Hallstrom said in a telephone interview from his home in Westchester County, N.Y. ''It's not the kind of story that needs the support of a modern score. It can take a light score, which can be elegant when it needs to be elegant. The editor and I were convinced we could do it with the old masters.''</p>
        <p>Executives at Touchstone Pictures, the division of the Walt Disney Company that released the movie, were initially less sure. ''This was an unusual approach for a Hollywood movie,'' Andrew Mondshein, the film's editor, said by telephone from his home in Larchmont, N.Y., ''and the studio was concerned that we wouldn't be able to do an entire score with original material.''</p>
        <p>Well, it was possible, and a CD soundtrack has been released to prove it. But the journey from idea to this reconstructed 18th-century score was anything but simple.</p>
        <p>It helped that Mr. Hallstrom's upbringing in Sweden was steeped in music: he attended a school that specialized in music and music history, and he played the piano, sang in choirs and composed music. Years later, he made pop videos for Swedish television, while one of his first Swedish-language feature films, ''Happy We,'' was set in the world of opera.</p>
        <p>For ''Casanova,'' though, he did not want a score that illustrated the action. ''I am suspicious of scores which support along the lines of what you're already seeing on the screen,'' he said. ''The American tendency is to underscore what it already up there. I wanted to add an irony or color or shading which doesn't go right along with the visuals.''</p>
        <p>Still, shooting began in Venice last year without a decision on the score. Leslie Holleran, Mr. Hallstrom's longtime producer, who is married to Mr. Mondshein, said she had even discussed an original score with a ''very famous and expensive'' composer. But, she added, the director's idea of making a ''broad operatic high farce'' in the spirit of commedia dell'arte kept leading them back to period music.</p>
        <p>While in Venice, with Baroque concerts being held in a church beside the movie's production office, Mr. Mondshein began selecting passages of 18th-century music and testing them on different scenes. Vivaldi is, of course, the Venetian composer par excellence. But, eager to avoid too-familiar music, Mr. Mondshein also turned to Vivaldi's contemporary, Tomaso Albinoni.</p>
        <p>Once the studio had given its tentative approval for period music, the production then recruited Roy Prendergast, a New York-based movie music editor with a background in classical music and composition. ''When I looked at the film, I thought, this is opera buffa, this is farce,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''and I realized that the opera repertory could provide the most cinematic material.''</p>
        <p>Although Vivaldi and Albinoni each wrote more than 50 operas, few of them have been recorded, and not all were in the opera buffa style. In contrast, Jean-Philippe Rameau, the 18th-century French composer, presented Mr. Prendergast with a rich choice of comic operas. ''Casanova'' includes no vocal excerpts, but Mr. Prendergast borrowed overtures and dances from eight Rameau operas, including ''Platée,'' ''Zoroastre'' and ''Zaïs.''</p>
        <p>''I sort of ripped through the entire recorded repertory and just pulled things that I felt would work,'' he recalled. ''I was aware of a large part of the Baroque repertory from my background, but there was also a lot of music that I discovered, which was delightful.''</p>
        <p>Vivaldi and Albinoni were not overlooked: there are passages from four Vivaldi concertos and one opera, ''Farnace,'' as well as from four Albinoni concertos. Four other Italian composers were also used -- Giovanni Paisiello, Arcangelo Corelli, Leonardo Leo and Francesco Durante -- as well as Vicente Martín y Soler, from Spain, and Johan Helmich Roman, from Sweden. Even Handel and Telemann make cameo appearances in the score.</p>
        <p>But what about Mozart? Although he was born in 1756, three years after the film is set, legend has it that he consulted Giacomo Casanova before composing ''Don Giovanni,'' his opera about another serial seducer. Indeed, there is evidence that Casanova himself attended the opera's premiere in Prague on Oct. 29, 1787.</p>
        <p>''After spending two weeks listening to nothing but Baroque music, I finally said, 'Well, now we can go to Mozart,' '' Mr. Prendergast said. ''And I started listening to Mozart, and it was as if I had just come out of a different era. My God, what a radical! Mozart's style was so very, very different from this material. It just didn't play.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Prendergast put together a track from existing recordings, but he found there were still gaps, notably in what he called ''the most intimate emotional moments.'' For these passages, the French composer Alexandre Desplat, who is credited for ''original music,'' and the American composer and conductor Sonny Kompanek wrote short sections in the Baroque style.</p>
        <p>The entire score also had to be rerecorded, and here, Mr. Prendergast needed to find original sheet music, itself no easy task. Then, through a copy-and-paste job, he created his final version, which runs for around 60 minutes of the 105-minute movie. In July, more than 40 Baroque musicians -- named the Hollywood Studio Symphony for the occasion -- joined Mr. Kompanek in New York to record the score, using period instruments.</p>
        <p>''I apologized to them beforehand,'' Mr. Prendergast recalled. ''I said, 'I am the person responsible for chopping all this music up.' But they were wonderful. They were all so delighted that Baroque music was getting this kind of exposure.''</p>
        <p>For his final edit, Mr. Mondshein said, his inspiration was comic opera. ''We mixed the music as another voice in the film, not as a background score,'' he said. To this, Ms. Holleran added excitedly: ''The music became the support on which the film could rest. It was a great adventure on top of a great adventure.''</p>
