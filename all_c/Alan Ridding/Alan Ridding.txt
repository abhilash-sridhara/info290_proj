Political movies may rank alongside biopics as worthy endeavors that rarely succeed at the box office, but at least they have a safe haven at the Berlin International Film Festival. Born of the politics of the cold war, the Berlinale, as it is known, continues to address serious political and social issues.
''As long as I am director, the Berlinale will always be in some way political because I am working in the tradition of the festival,'' Dieter Kosslick said on Thursday just before the 54th edition, which will end on Sunday. Of course it also needs star power, provided this year by American movies like ''Cold Mountain'' and ''Something's Gotta Give,'' which used Berlin to start their European releases. But there are enough political movies in competition to secure the festival's identity.
One of this year's themes, Mr. Kosslick said, was South Africa, to note the 10th anniversary of the end of apartheid. And he was helped by John Boorman's ''Country of My Skull,'' which combined a weighty subject with Juliette Binoche and Samuel L. Jackson in leading roles. Sony Pictures Classics acquired North American rights to the film even before it was shown.
The film, based on a nonfiction book of that name by Antjie Krog, follows South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission as it tries to heal the wounds of apartheid by inviting perpetrators of racial violence to confess their crimes in front of their victims. The screen version then injects a love story between a white South African radio reporter, Anna Malan (Ms. Binoche), and a black Washington Post reporter, Langston Whitfield (Mr. Jackson).
The film centers on Anna as an Afrikaaner who faces the horrors done in the name of her race, Mr. Boorman (''Deliverance'' and ''Hope and Glory'') told reporters. ''Her relationship with Langston mirrors the larger situation in the commission and the country -- people finding ways of coming together and finding love,'' he said.
The strongest scenes show the commission as it travels around South African villages to hear witnesses and confessions. But halfway through the movie the love story begins to swamp the political story in sentimentality, and in the end the movie disappointed most film critics here.
If one purpose of political movies is to raise moral issues, ''Svjedoci'' (''Witnesses'') by the Croatian director Vinko Bresan proved more convincing. Based on Jurica Pavicic's novel ''Alabaster Sheep,'' it is set in the early 1990's during Croatia's war with Serbia and opens with three Croatian soldiers on leave from the front who decide to blow up the home of a Serb still living in Croatia. Through incompetence, they end up shooting the man and kidnapping his small daughter.
What follows is more unexpected. Even as dead and wounded Croats are being brought back from the war front, a few people in the town, notably a police detective and a journalist, decide that the cold-blooded murder of a Serb civilian, even one said to be getting rich as a smuggler, is not acceptable. To scrutinize this question from all sides, Mr. Bresan breaks the linear narrative by returning to key moments and seeing them from the point of view of different characters.
While the moral dilemmas raised are universal, Mr. Bresan also sought to draw attention to crimes committed by Croatians. ''In our society, our war crimes are not yet fully discussed or even defined,'' he said. ''It is necessary to talk of a system of evil created within our own society. And it is something difficult to fight, even with laws. If the film's ending is optimistic, it is not our reality, but what we would like to wish for.''
Less directly political but no less effective is Hans Petter Moland's ''Beautiful Country,'' based on an idea by Terrence Malick, who is also one of its producers. The movie follows Binh (Damien Nguyen), a young Vietnamese fathered by a G.I. during the Vietnam War, as he leaves his village for Ho Chi Minh City and eventually heads for the United States to find his father.
Accompanied by his small half-brother, Binh arrives in a small boat in Malaysia where, in a refugee camp, he meets Ling (Ling Bai), a beautiful Chinese woman who also dreams of reaching America. They soon find themselves with scores of other migrants in the hold of a dilapidated ship run by a smuggler captain (Tim Roth). Binh's little brother dies on board, but Binh and Ling make it to New York, where Binh continues to search for his father (Nick Nolte).
What makes the movie so gripping is not only the fine acting by Mr. Nguyen and Ms. Bai but also the ordinariness of the experience of the migrants: on any day there may be thousands of similar refugees from Asia and Africa crossing the seas in such perilous rust buckets.
''We did not want to glorify anything,'' said Mr. Molland, a Norwegian director (''Aberdeen''). ''The film is an odyssey and we tried to be true to the spirit of the voyage, which is not heroic.''
The migration issue, so topical in Europe today, is also examined in two films to be shown later this week. Ken Loach's ''Ae Fond Kiss'' echoes the ''Romeo and Juliet'' theme as Casim, the son of Pakistani immigrants to Scotland, falls in love with a young Catholic woman. And ''Gegen die Wand'' (''Head-On''), by the Turkish-German director Faith Akin, dwells on Sibel, the daughter of Turkish immigrants to Germany, who is trying to escape her strict Muslim home.
Perhaps the surprise of the festival so far is ''El Abrazo Partido'' (''Lost Embrace'') by the young Argentine director Daniel Burman. Made for under $1 million, it follows Ariel (Daniel Hendler), the grandson of Jews from Poland, as he tries to obtain a Polish passport to escape the narrow world of Jewish shopkeepers in the Barrio del Once in Buenos Aires. What holds him is the mystery of why his father left one day for Israel and never returned.
In its portrayal of the daily lives and loves of the struggling shopkeepers in a run-down mall, the movie provided the first humor of the festival's competition program, a humor that is both Jewish and Argentine.
The movie also explores the absent father-son relationship that consumes Ariel. ''I think it is interesting to show that father-son relationships are fictitious,'' the director said. ''They have to be built, compared to the mother-son relationship, which is a given. So the film is also about how someone goes about constructing the image of his father.''
	From the start of the prolonged offstage drama that has been convulsing Berlin's opera world since the late 1990's, two inescapable and contradictory realities seemed likely to determine the outcome. Financially, the city government could no longer afford to maintain three opera houses in the style to which they had become accustomed. Politically, it could not afford to close any of them.
The solution that has now been imposed by the Berlin Senate, amid squeals of dismay and sighs of resignation, was predictable. The three opera houses -- the Deutsche Staatsoper Unter den Linden, the Deutsche Oper and the Komische Oper -- will remain open, but they must cut costs, including 220 jobs, and learn to live on smaller subsidies. They are also to share workshops, and will shortly merge their three ballet companies into a single Staatsballett Berlin.
''We are starting a new chapter,'' said Georg Vierthaler, the Staatsoper's managing director, in an interview last month. ''In time we will see if it is a comedy, drama or tragedy.''
With the German economy in a slump, traditionally generous cultural subsidies are being trimmed across the country. Berlin's situation, though, is special. During the cold war, governments on both sides of the divided city promoted culture for propaganda purposes. After 1990, a united Berlin inherited three opera houses, eight orchestras and 17 theaters, but it lost many of its financial privileges.
As its budget deficit mounted through the 1990's, the city's coddled opera houses became targets for austerity measures. The opera managements protested, with the Staatsoper's music director, Daniel Barenboim, threatening to resign. But dependent on city government subsidies for $142 million of their collective $196 million annual budget, the houses could not elude political pressure.
And as they came under the spotlight, something else was revealed: they were in need of a good shake-up. For 14 years the three houses -- the Deutsche Oper in former West Berlin and the Staatsoper and Komische Oper in former East Berlin -- have been operating as independent fiefs, mirroring the old divide. Now they will be expected to respond more faithfully to the interests of a united Berlin.
Though it is once again the federal capital, Berlin is a relatively poor city lacking an industrial or financial base. One of its principal assets is culture, not only its fine museums and the legendary Berlin Philharmonic but also its opera houses. Yet unlike, say, the Vienna State Opera, Berlin opera houses have never reached out to tourists, even though attendance by Berliners is falling. Now Berlin's politicians want more for their money.
The key is the creation of the new Berlin Opera Foundation. Headed by a general manager to be named by the city, the foundation will have control over the three opera houses, the new Staatsballett and the service company that will manage costume and décor workshops. The foundation's component parts are all represented on a 10-member executive board, and have collective responsibility for opera and ballet in Berlin.
''In the past when they were in debt they'd come to the Senate and hold out their hand and ask for help,'' said Barbara Kisseler, the city's under secretary for culture, who is overseeing the reform. ''Now this has to be sorted out by the foundation.''
This was also a condition laid down by the federal government when it offered to help resolve the crisis. Reluctant to be seen directly subsidizing opera, it took charge of four city museums, freeing up $21 million in city funds, which are to be used by the foundation. Without that money the annual opera and ballet subsidy would have fallen to $100 million from $142 million; now it will level off at $121 million in 2009.
But that still leaves the foundation with a projected shortfall of $21 million, which will be only partly covered by the savings -- about $12 million -- achieved through sharing workshops and cutting, among artists, 18 musicians from the opera orchestras, 7 singers from the choruses and 28 dancers from the ballet companies. With the subsidy being reduced in stages, the foundation will be in the red again in 2007.
This has persuaded Mr. Barenboim and Peter Mussbach, the Staatsoper's general manager and artistic director, to oppose the changes. ''From 2007 the foundation will be in trouble,'' Mr. Mussbach said. ''The politicians are ceding their responsibilities to those who are the victims. They know full well that three opera houses cannot survive. But if one of them closes, it will be the fault of the foundation, not the politicians. This is a political trick.''
Mr. Barenboim and Mr. Mussbach also complain that the Staatsoper and its renowned orchestra, the Staatskapelle, are victims of success. While the Deutsche Oper and the Komische Oper have been operating with a deficit, the Staatsoper has prospered. A recent sold-out performance of Wagner's ''Meistersinger von Nürnberg,'' conducted by Simone Young, with the German baritone Falk Struckmann as Hans Sachs, was evidence of its musical excellence.
The Staatsoper still receives a hefty subsidy, but it averages 80 percent attendance -- compared with 68 percent at the Deutsche Oper and 50 percent at the Komische Oper -- and has been more creative in its programming. There was an early-music festival last month, and at an Easter Festival in April Mr. Barenboim is to conduct new productions of Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' Tchaikovsky's ''Queen of Spades'' and three concerts by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
Mr. Barenboim's greatest fear is that the foundation will not respect the artistic independence of each house. ''If the foundation has a general manager who is responsible for all three houses,'' he said in a recent interview with the German weekly Die Zeit, ''it's not very credible that each house will keep its own identity. In the end, we won't have three different houses but only one house with three stages.''
Yet a common criticism has been that the houses lack clear identities. There was, for instance, frequent programming duplication, including one famous night when all three presented Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro.'' It is therefore likely that the foundation will encourage the houses to develop different profiles. ''At the moment the repertories of the Deutsche Oper and the Staatsoper are interchangeable,'' Ms. Kisseler said.
If the Staatsoper feels victimized, the mood at the other two houses is more upbeat, if only because they started the year without a deficit. Still, each faces major problems. The Komische Oper's general manager and artistic director, Andreas Homoki, has lost some of the company's traditional East Berlin audience by modernizing productions.
The Deutsche Oper has been focusing on importing top singers -- the American tenor Robert Gambill recently sang the lead in Wagner's ''Tannhaüser'' -- but it has been without a general manager since Udo Zimmermann was forced out last year by the music director, Christian Thielemann. Ms. Kisseler said the house needed a general manager and a music director who work together.
As for the foundation's projected 2007 deficit, Ms. Kisseler said there was ample room for increasing efficiency in nonartistic areas and raising box office and other revenues. ''We need centralized artistic marketing to fill the houses,'' she said. ''At present there is not even central ticketing. Until now each house was interested only in itself. In future we have to serve the interests of all opera in Berlin.''
Correction:  March 3, 2004, Wednesday  A picture caption yesterday with an article about Berlin's three opera houses misspelled the name of a work heard recently at the Deutsche Staatsoper. It is ''Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,'' not Miestersinger.
	Given the disturbing level of animosity between the West and much of the Islamic world, can increased appreciation of Islamic art in the West help bridge the cultural divide? Is that notion overly optimistic? Perhaps. But since the shock of Sept. 11, 2001, interest in understanding the Islamic world through its art has been growing.
Certainly, with all the tension caused by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the war in Iraq, Al Qaeda and Muslim migration to Europe, probably nothing separates the West and the Islamic world more than cultural misunderstanding. This may not be new, but it can no longer be ignored. And it is too much to expect ''public diplomacy,'' today's euphemism for cultural propaganda, to provide a quick fix.
Instead, a case is being made for the benefits of promoting Islamic art in the West: the Islamic world would feel that its heritage was admired in countries that increasingly link Islam with terrorism; Westerners could look beyond today's turmoil to recognize one of the world's great civilizations; and alienated Muslim youths in Europe could identify with the glories of their Islamic roots.
Thanks to 19th-century explorers and travelers, fine Islamic art collections are plentiful in the West. The Pergamon Museum in Berlin, for instance, has housed a Museum of Islamic Art for more than a century. Yet all too often Islamic art has been hard to find in museums; invariably, it is treated as a poor relative of Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities.
Now, troubled times are changing this.
In 2002 President Jacques Chirac of France proposed creating a new department of Islamic art in the Louvre to underline ''the essential contribution of Islamic civilizations to our culture.'' Recently, the Louvre announced that a large courtyard would be covered in glass and redesigned to house its Islamic collection, now in underground corridors. The project will cost $60 million and take five years to complete.
''Obviously, this has a political dimension,'' said the minister of culture, Jean-Jacques Aillagon. ''It's a way of saying we believe in the equality of civilizations.'' He added: ''Many immigrant youths do not fully adhere to our culture, nor do they know their own culture of origin. It's good to show that the republic respects, displays and studies this culture.''
In London, the Victoria and Albert Museum will present its rich Islamic collection in a spectacular new gallery by 2006, thanks to a $9.7 million gift from Mohammed Jameel, the president of a Saudi business conglomerate. Announcing the gift two months ago, Mr. Jameel said one of his family's objectives was to increase understanding of the Islamic world.
Mark Jones, the director of the Victoria and Albert, said the new Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art would highlight the diversity of world culture. ''Do we want to confront prejudice?'' he asked. ''Yes, we want to undermine negative attitudes that people bring with them. It's absurd for some people to claim that Islamic culture is a barbaric culture. If you see what there is here, you can't possibly think it is hostile to beauty or education and has no intellectual tradition.''
While work is under way, the Victoria and Albert will do its own proselytizing by lending 100 of its prized Islamic objects for temporary exhibition at the National Gallery in Washington, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, the Setagaya Art Museum in Tokyo and the Millennium Galleries in Sheffield, England. Meanwhile, ''Heaven on Earth: Art From Islamic Lands,'' which presents 60 treasures from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, is on display at the Hermitage's London home in Somerset House through Aug. 22.
Temporary shows often create a special buzz. That was the case with ''Islamic Art and Patronage'' from the private collection of Sheik Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah and his wife, Sheika Hussah Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah, who are members of the Kuwaiti royal family. The show traveled to 22 sites around the world and drew large crowds.
''I'd see a man with a long beard standing next to an elegant lady, sharing a moment,'' Sheika Hussah said. ''Maybe through art we can bring people together.''
In New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Islamic galleries are closed for renovation. ''Given the present geopolitical situation and increased public interest in Islamic art, this is an unfortunate moment to announce the temporary closing of the Islamic Galleries,'' Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director, conceded last year. But the result, he said, will be to show this art ''side-by-side with related works from other cultures.''
Like the Louvre and the Victoria and Albert, then, the Met intends to place Islamic art within the context of universal culture. This in turn will help illustrate the influence of Islamic art on architecture and design in the West, most noticeably in the 19th century.
Some museums, though, have chosen to focus exclusively on Islamic art. One highlight is the new Benaki Museum of Islamic Art in Athens. It is to open in two renovated 19th-century houses in June, in time for the Summer Olympics, displaying an Islamic collection built up by Antonis Benakis in the early 20th century, at the same time that he was building up a treasury of Greek antiquities. ''Greece has always had relations with the Arab world, and it's important to know its art,'' said Mina Moraitou, the collection's curator. ''Islamic art can show the beauty of its art, language and literature, that Islamic religion is not only about jihad.''
Yet the new interest in Islamic art within the Islamic world is just as important. Cairo and Istanbul have long boasted excellent collections, but a new Museum of Islamic Art, designed by I. M. Pei, is being built in Doha, Qatar. Due to open in 2006, it is the brainchild of Sheik Saud Ibn Muhammad Al Thani, chairman of the National Council of Arts and Heritage, who has been building up Qatar's collection since the mid-1990's.
Oliver Watson, the collection's curator, who is on loan from the Victoria and Albert, underscored the relationship between artistic heritage and the current climate. ''People say that at this moment it is more important to recognize that the Middle East and the Islamic world was in its day as advanced culturally, as well as economically and militarily, as any country or empire in the world,'' he said. Mr. Jones, the Victoria and Albert's director, put it more simply: ''It's no coincidence that people are more interested in Islamic art than ever.''
