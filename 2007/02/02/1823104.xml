        <p>KAVANAGH--Roger P. III, president and chief executive officer of Intermarine, a New Orleans shipping company, died Monday of cancer at his home in Metairie. He was 54. Mr. Kavanagh was born in Greensboro, NC, and graduated from Princeton University in 1975. Choosing a career in ocean shipping, he decided to concentrate on transporting complex industrial equipment such as refinery components, power plants and other unusually large items. After settling in New Orleans, he founded Intermarine in 1990 to provide specialized breakbulk project transportation. Now one of New Orleans' largest privately held companies, it also has offices in Houston, Shanghai, Buenos Aires and Caracas, Venezuela. Mr. Kavanagh also was a past president of Transoceanic Shipping Company and Gulfship Marine. In 1996, he received the Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the accounting and consulting firm Ernst &amp; Young. In October 2006 the Journal of Commerce awarded him its Lifetime Leadership and Achievement Award. Survivors include his wife, Danielle Haynes Kavanagh; two sons, Zachary Pierce and Dylan Michael Kavanagh; a daughter, Sophie Jeanette Kavanagh; and a brother, Basil John Kavanagh. A Mass will be said Saturday, 2 pm at St. Patrick Catholic Church, 724 Camp St., New Orleans. Visitation will begin at noon. Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home is in charge of services.</p>
