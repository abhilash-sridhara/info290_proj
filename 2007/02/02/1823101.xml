        <p>GREENBERG--Lynne. Lynne was born on October 16th, 1964 and passed away quietly after a courageous battle against Melanoma on January 31st, 2007. Lynne was a devoted and loving mother, wife, daughter, sister, and friend. She had a successful career in sports and event marketing with Millsport, Inc. and Major League Events in Manhattan from 1986-2003, when she retired to become a full-time mother. Her joy for life, her positive attitude, her endearing character, her loyalty, generosity and caring for others are an inspiration to those that knew her. Lynne is survived by her husband Edward, her son Jordan, her daughter Emily, her parents Rosa and Sheldon Ilowite, sister Leslie Rothstein and her husband Roy, brother-in-law Peter Greenberg and his wife Carolina, and many nieces and nephews. Funeral services will be held at the All Souls Unitarian Church on Lexington Ave., on Friday at 11:00 am with interment at the Mt. Hebron Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Lynne's memory to the NYU Cancer Institute for Melanoma Research Fund. Please call Jane MacDonald for info at (212) 404-3738.</p>
