        <p>The authorities said Wednesday that they had expanded the investigation of a man accused of kidnapping two boys, to include a search of one of his previous apartments, as well as looking into whether he may have had a connection to an unsolved Illinois killing in 2003.</p>
        <p>The man, Michael Devlin, 41, of Kirkwood, Mo., a St. Louis suburb, is charged in the abductions of Shawn Hornbeck, 15, and William Ownby, 13, who were found Jan. 12 in a search of Mr. Devlin's apartment.</p>
        <p>Across the Mississippi River in Illinois, the Livingston County sheriff, Robert McCarty, said his deputies were investigating whether Mr. Devlin could be linked to the 2003 killing of 7-year-old Dalton Mesarchik.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if we're at the point where we'd consider him a person of interest,'' the sheriff said of Mr. Devlin. ''We're not even saying there is a connection, but we do have an interest in making sure there's nothing that would place him in Livingston County around the time of Dalton's death.''</p>
        <p>In Kirkwood, a police officer who said he was not authorized to speak publicly said the search of Mr. Devlin's former apartment was part of a ''routine investigation.''</p>
        <p>The Washington County prosecutor, John Rupp, said Mr. Devlin had waived his right to a formal arraignment, opting that a not-guilty plea be entered on his behalf.</p>
        <p>A former pizzeria manager, Mr. Devlin has been charged with kidnapping and armed criminal action in the 2002 abduction of the Hornbeck boy.</p>
        <p>The authorities said Mr. Devlin had brandished a gun when he abducted Shawn, then 11, near the boy's home in Richwoods, Mo.</p>
        <p>In neighboring Franklin County, Mr. Devlin has pleaded not guilty to one count of kidnapping in the Ownby abduction. The boy, known as Ben, disappeared Jan. 8 from an area near his home in Beaufort, Mo.</p>
