        <p>A fragile peace was fraying in Nepal on Wednesday, as ethnic violence went on unabated on its southern plains, a police officer was hacked to death and the prime minister was prompted to call for an end to the bloodletting.</p>
        <p>The United Nations chief envoy to Nepal has already warned that the trouble in the plains, the Terai region along the Indian border, endangered the possibility of landmark elections this summer.</p>
        <p>The violence broke out two weeks ago when the majority people of the Terai, the Madhesis, complained about the way the voting districts had been drawn for the elections. Madhesis have long been aggrieved by the domination of Nepal's politics by ethnic communities from the hills.</p>
        <p>The Madhesis, descendants of migrants from India several generations ago, make up as much as 30 percent of Nepal's population. Until late last year, thousands were denied citizenship rights because they could not prove Nepali nationality.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said in a televised address on Wednesday evening that he would push for Nepal to have a federal system of government, one of the Madhesis' chief demands.</p>
        <p>''Given my age and my health, it could very well be my last message,'' said Mr. Koirala, who is 84. ''I make an appeal to all to stop all strikes and agitations that have been launched in some parts of the country, and resolve the crisis through dialogue, and maintain peace and harmony in the country.''</p>
        <p>Ten people have been killed in the last two weeks in protests over the redistricting. Several towns in the Terai have been under curfew. Blockades called by some Madhesi groups have brought several southern towns to a standstill. The police arrested three former ministers of the royalist government on Tuesday, including the onetime home minister, Kamal Thapa, accusing them of inciting violence.</p>
        <p>By putting the planned elections in jeopardy, the troubles threaten to unravel a delicate peace deal intended to end more than a decade of Maoist conflict that has claimed an estimated 13,000 lives. Under the accord, signed in November, the Maoists joined the government and agreed to sequester their weapons under United Nations supervision.</p>
        <p>Elections are to be held in June to choose an assembly to draft a new constitution. The outcome could decide whether Nepal's monarchy will survive. The Maoists have made its abolition the centerpiece of their platform.</p>
        <p>No dates have been set for the polls, which would be the first in Nepal in eight years. Ian Martin, the United Nations secretary general's representative in Nepal, said Friday that the election schedule ''can only be jeopardized if the situation in the Terai continues or escalates.''</p>
