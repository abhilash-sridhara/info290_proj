        <p>More than half of 1.8 million black adults living in France say they have been the victims of racism in their everyday lives, according to a survey commissioned by the Representative Council of Black Associations, a black advocacy group, and conducted by TNS-Sofres for the newspaper Le Parisien. It found that 56 percent believed they had been discriminated against, with 61 percent saying they had endured at least one incident of discrimination in the last year. Close to one in four said they had been insulted or verbally abused. ''These statistics show what this society does not want to hear or see,'' said Patrick Lozes, the president of the representative council.</p>
