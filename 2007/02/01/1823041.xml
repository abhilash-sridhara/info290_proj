        <p>Correction of Jan 29 obituary of Robert F Drinan</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An obituary by The Associated Press on Monday about the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Jesuit priest who served in Congress for 10 years, attributed an erroneous distinction to him. He was the first of two Catholic priests to serve as a voting delegate in Congress -- not the only one. (Robert J. Cornell of Wisconsin was the second, serving two terms. At least two Episcopal priests have also been members of Congress.) The obituary also incorrectly described Father Drinan's attire while serving in Congress. He normally wore a dark suit with clerical collar, not the robes of his clerical order.</p>
