        <p>Last week, the designer Patrick Jouin seemed to be the toast of Paris. On Friday, Mr. Jouin, right, known for designing restaurants like the Plaza Athénée in Paris and Mix in Las Vegas (both in collaboration with the chef Alain Ducasse), was on hand to celebrate the centennial of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, whose store in the Place Vendôme he recently redesigned. For the jeweler, he said, he mixed styles and periods ''like a D.J.'' to create an eclectic, sensual space with twisting vines, flowers, butterflies and fairies in the form of bas relief and wood carvings; the centerpiece is a semicircular frieze of silver roses surrounding a glass-bubble chandelier suspended above jewel cases, top. ''In one step you are in another dimension, a world of fantasy,'' Mr. Jouin said.</p>
        <p>Across town, at the Maison et Objet design fair, the busy Mr. Jouin unveiled a pasta pot ($238), above left, created for Alessi (again in collaboration with Mr. Ducasse). Made of layered stainless steel and aluminum to distribute heat evenly, it is designed to cook pasta with vegetables and oil but little water, producing a thick stew, similar to a risotto. The pot will be available in April at Alessi SoHo, 130 Greene Street (Prince Street), (212) 941-7300. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, 22 place Vendôme, Paris, 011-33-1-53-45-45-45.</p>
