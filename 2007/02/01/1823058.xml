        <p>After three weeks of dismal sales, the music industry rebounded a little last week with two new albums selling more than 100,000 copies, a benchmark that in healthier times is usually met by most if not all of the albums in the Top 10. The biggest seller was ''Late Night Special'' (Atlantic) by the Miami R&amp;B quartet Pretty Ricky, with 132,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan. No. 2 was ''Wincing the Night Away'' (Sub Pop) by the indie-rock favorites the Shins; a notable 30 percent of its 118,000 sales were digital downloads. The ''American Idol'' alumnus Chris Daughtry fell two spots to No. 3 with his album ''Daughtry'' (RCA). The next two spots on the chart are occupied by new releases: the compilation ''2007 Grammy Nominees'' (Commercial Music Group) was No. 4 with sales of 77,000, and John Mellencamp's new ''Freedom's Road'' (Universal) sold 56,000 copies, reaching No. 5, his highest-ever opening position on the Billboard chart.</p>
