        <p>Reduce poverty, win millions.</p>
        <p>The X Prize Foundation, which awarded $10 million to the maker of a private space vehicle in 2004, said Wednesday that it was starting a broad fund-raising campaign to raise $50 million. The money will be used to reward other innovators.</p>
        <p>Over the next few years, the group plans to create contests that spur innovative thinking about poverty, energy consumption and health care, among other issues, said Tom Vander Ark, president of the foundation, which is based in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The group said it was holding a March 3 event at Google's headquarters to kick off the new fund-raising effort. Mr. Vander Ark said the group planned to award $200 million or more in 10 to 15 new prize categories over the next five years.</p>
        <p>The X Prize ''takes action by clearly defining the goal and providing the incentive for progress,'' Mr. Vander Ark said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The group is starting a contest to reward development of a hyperefficient car, able to get at least 100 miles a gallon. The car must be in production and available for purchase. The prize is likely to be $25 million, Mr. Vander Ark said.</p>
        <p>It awarded a $10 million purse to a company led by the aircraft designer Burt Rutan and the Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen. They built a vehicle that went into suborbital space in 2004.</p>
        <p>Last October the foundation announced that it would award $10 million for technology that can map 100 human genomes in 10 days.</p>
