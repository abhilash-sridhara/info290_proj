        <p>The Tatu collection from the housewares company Artecnica is as good for South African artisans as it is for your patio. Developed by Stephen Burks, a New York designer, in collaboration with a wire weaver from one of Cape Town's poorest townships, the steel wire tables and stools unite contemporary design with African handicraft. The modular tables break down into a basket, bowl and tray, shown in white, from left (the coffee table, in red, above left, is $550; the side table, above right, is $450). ''The goal is to elevate the level of craft,'' Mr. Burks said, to create a sustainable source of income for the community. The collection will be available in March; store locations are listed at artecnicainc.com.</p>
