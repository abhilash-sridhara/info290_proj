        <p>The parents of an infant girl whose body was found at the bottom of a trash chute in a Mott Haven apartment building were arrested yesterday after a tip was received, the police said. The baby's father, Juan Rodriguez, 32, was charged with second-degree murder, and her mother, Maribel Caceres, 21, with unlawful disposal of a human body, the police said. The death of the 5-week-old girl, identified as Giovonna Marie Rodriguez, has been ruled a homicide, the result of smothering and blunt impact injuries to her head, said a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, Ellen S. Borakove. The police said that the couple dropped Giovonna down the chute in the Willis Avenue building on Monday. Mr. Rodriguez and Ms. Caceres had been living together in Hempstead, on Long Island, a law enforcement official said. The police said that it was unclear what connection they had to the Bronx building, but that Mr. Rodriguez may have lived in the neighborhood at one time.</p>
