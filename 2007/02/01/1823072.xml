        <p>Hong Kong is poised to hold the first election in more than half a century that includes a democracy advocate seeking high office. The politician, Alan Leong, the former chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, announced that he had obtained enough nominations to appear on the ballot to become the territory's next chief executive but acknowledged that he had no chance of beating the popular Beijing-backed incumbent, Donald Tsang. Under rules imposed by Chinese officials, only 796 people on the election committee -- most with close ties to the mainland -- will be allowed to vote in the March 25 election. It will be the first contested election for chief executive since Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, and it will be a secret ballot.</p>
