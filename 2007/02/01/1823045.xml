        <p>Fourteen employees of the Fire Department of New York bought phony diplomas over the Internet and submitted them to the city in an attempt to meet educational requirements for being promoted or hired, according to a report released yesterday by the Department of Investigation.</p>
        <p>Of the 14 employees, 3 were promoted in 2001 and 2002 based on the phony degrees; they did not have the required college credits.</p>
        <p>The other 11 turned in phony diplomas that were subsequently rejected; 10 were promoted or hired anyway because they eventually obtained enough legitimate credits, but one was improperly promoted without proper credits.</p>
        <p>Asked whether any employees would be punished or promotions rescinded, a Fire Department spokesman, Francis X. Gribbon, said officials had awaited the completion of the investigation ''before proceeding with any disciplinary actions that may be warranted.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''That review is now under way.''</p>
        <p>The report says several of the 14 employees had suspicions about the degrees and expressed their misgivings to peers and supervisors.</p>
        <p>The phony diplomas were purchased from St. Regis University, described by federal prosecutors as a diploma mill that churned out thousands of fake degrees, at hundreds of dollars apiece, from a base near Spokane, Wash., using various Web sites.</p>
        <p>In October 2005, a federal grand jury in Spokane indicted eight people at St. Regis on charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Three have pleaded guilty. The other five cases are pending, including those of Dixie E. Randock and Steven K. Randock Sr., who were described as the main owners of St. Regis and were also charged with money laundering.</p>
        <p>St. Regis had called itself an ''online distance learning institution,'' based in Liberia and accredited by the Education Ministry there.</p>
        <p>''The officers simply paid for a piece of paper,'' according to the investigative report, which added, ''In fact, all of the officers admitted that they did no work beyond writing a short life experience essay.''</p>
        <p>The Fire Department stopped accepting St. Regis diplomas in 2003 after officials determined that it was not an accredited institution. Nonetheless, the report said the department's policy of accepting degrees based on ''life experience'' became ''the catalyst for activity which was dubious at best and in some cases simply dishonest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gribbon said the Fire Department had revamped its procedures for reviewing credentials. He said the department had promoted 2,500 employees and had to make promotions more frequently after losing 343 employees in the 9/11 attack.</p>
        <p>According to the report, some confusion led officials to accept three phony diplomas. In 2002, Victor Herbert, a supervisor of tenure and promotions, wrote a letter that appeared to validate the St. Regis degrees when, in fact, he mistakenly believed the degrees were from Regis College, a legitimate Catholic liberal arts institution in Weston, Mass.</p>
        <p>The three officers promoted based on their phony diplomas were identified as Deputy Chiefs Paul Ferro and Richard Howe and Battalion Chief Daniel O'Gara.</p>
        <p>Ten others were promoted or hired based on legitimate credentials, after submitting St. Regis degrees that were rejected: Battalion Chiefs Gary Esposito and John Polly; Capts. Donald Brown, Martin Cass, Mark Barra, Thomas Fitzgerald and Lawrence Sloan; Lts. Ralph Talarico and Matthew Zitz; and Firefighter Mark Thalheimer.</p>
        <p>According to the report, Edward O'Donnell was promoted to captain in 2004, even though his St. Regis transcript had been rejected and he did not have enough credits.</p>
        <p>The department would not make any of the 14 employees available for comment yesterday.</p>
