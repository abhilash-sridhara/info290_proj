        <p>Bridge has seen its fair share of marriages and divorces. Tomorrow, though, is the 20th anniversary of the first date of Eileen Brenner and Michael Pickert of Livingston, N.J.</p>
        <p>They used to play a lot of bridge but now restrict their time at the table. Later this month they will compete in the final of the New Jersey Double Knockout with their teammates, Alex Allen of Annandale, N.J., and Abe Pineles of Jackson, N.J. These team events are fun because you must be beaten twice to be eliminated. The diagramed deal comes from their semifinal match.</p>
        <p>Pickert (South) had to make a negative double on the first round because a two-spade response would have been nonforcing (a so-called negative free bid). The rest of the auction was natural. Note, though, East's undisciplined three-club rebid; he said it all on the first round. Three clubs doubled would have cost 800, but it was impossible for South to double for a second time.</p>
        <p>Declarer, after winning the club lead on the board with the ace, was unwilling to play a heart to his ace and a heart to dummy's jack. He was afraid that East would win with the queen from an initial doubleton, cash the club king and continue with a third club, promoting West's heart ten as a trick. Although we can see that that would not have happened, it was lucky South did not adopt this line, because the bad heart break would have led to his defeat.</p>
        <p>Instead South played a spade to his ace, cashed the spade king, discarding a club from the dummy, and led his diamond, dummy's ten losing to East's queen. East cashed the club king, then played the spade nine, covered by the jack and queen and ruffed on the board.</p>
        <p>This line of defense, forcing the dummy to ruff, suggested that the trumps were breaking badly. Declarer felt that East had 3-1-3-6 distribution, but just to check, South called for a low diamond, ruffing when East played the nine. Declarer continued with a heart to dummy's king (necessary if East had the singleton queen), took a diamond ruff in his hand and cashed the spade eight to give this end position:</p>
        <p>The lead of the last spade assured two more trump tricks for Pickert, 10 in all and a beaming smile from his partner at and away from the bridge table.</p>
        <p>In the other room the declarer lost his way, and Pickert's team gained 13 international match points.</p>
