        <p>Re ''Your MasterCard or Your Life,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 22): The problem of the uninsured and the rising costs of health care are critical national issues that deserve serious and thoughtful consideration. Suggesting that credit cards are to blame sidesteps the issue.</p>
        <p>Credit cards have provided enormous benefits to the United States economy, making transactions more convenient and secure and assuring small businesses, including doctors, of payment.</p>
        <p>While many consumers appreciate having a card in case of medical or other emergencies, no one's life should literally depend on it. Nor should anyone have to choose between physical and financial health.</p>
        <p>The fact that so many have had to face that choice doesn't reflect an inherent problem with credit products. It shows the need to address important shortcomings of our nation's health care system.</p>
