        <p>The ''Arpeggione'' Sonata, as played by David Finckel and Wu Han at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum on Tuesday, is another example of irresistible Schubert written for a medium that no longer exists. Living room soirees, four-handed piano music and fraternity group sings are not exactly the mother's milk of today's music business. Neither is the curious instrument for which this sonata was written: a kind of guitar with a bow, invented in the first part of the 19th century and pretty much extinct by the end of it.</p>
        <p>Transferred to the cello it is a magical piece. Whether it is better on the original arpeggione, I am helpless to say. It is obvious that Schubert was determined to make use of its strumming effects, but these are minor incidents in music whose inexhaustible lyricism over three movements is scarcely to be believed. If there is a finite amount of musical beauty in the world, it seems unfair that one brief composition should hoard so much of it.</p>

        <p>The ''Arpeggione'' Sonata, as played by David Finckel and Wu Han at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum on Tuesday, is another example of irresistible Schubert written for a medium that no longer exists. Living room soirees, four-handed piano music and fraternity group sings are not exactly the mother's milk of today's music business. Neither is the curious instrument for which this sonata was written: a kind of guitar with a bow, invented in the first part of the 19th century and pretty much extinct by the end of it.</p>
        <p>Transferred to the cello it is a magical piece. Whether it is better on the original arpeggione, I am helpless to say. It is obvious that Schubert was determined to make use of its strumming effects, but these are minor incidents in music whose inexhaustible lyricism over three movements is scarcely to be believed. If there is a finite amount of musical beauty in the world, it seems unfair that one brief composition should hoard so much of it.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, this cello-piano duo played Strauss's early Sonata in F, Rachmaninoff's songful ''Vocalise'' and the A-minor duo-sonata of Grieg, which is to my mind one of his more unfortunate adventures into Germanic bombast.</p>
        <p>It is hard to assign a style to these players. Mr. Finckel is a musician of great elegance and dignity. The size of his playing grows and narrows according to the music in front of him, but the fastidious articulation is always present. Rachmaninoff's effusiveness, Grieg's big bangs and Schubert's melodic flow are all given the same room to breathe.</p>
        <p>Wu Han is a similarly adjustable pianist. The piano parts of the ''Arpeggione'' had a muted, matte sonority alluding to Schubert's more modest instrument. Strauss and Grieg were more exclamatory and sharply colored. The latter piece finds Grieg chasing after the German formalism to which he aspired all his life. From time to time the rhetorical clouds thin and disperse, and we hear his own voice -- singing simply and truly and, like Schubert, irresistibly.</p>
