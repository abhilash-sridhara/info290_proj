        <p>The former husband of a woman fatally shot as she sat in her car in a Staten Island park-and-ride lot was being held by the state police in South Carolina yesterday, a law enforcement official said. The former husband, John Galtieri, a retired New York City police sergeant, was stopped in South Carolina because the car he was driving matched the description of a car seen leaving the parking lot where the body of the woman, Jeanne Kane, was found Tuesday, the official said. The police said Mr. Galtieri retired in 1980 after 14 years with the Police Department. Ms. Kane, 58, and Mr. Galtieri were divorced in 2003, according to relatives. Maureen Kane Pullman, Ms. Kane's sister, said of Mr. Galtieri, ''He was obsessed with her.'' The couple appeared together in State Supreme Court earlier Tuesday over litigation that Mr. Galtieri had brought against Ms. Kane, according to the law enforcement official, who would not elaborate on the nature of the suit.</p>
