        <p>The Toshiba Satellite A135-S4499 has a fairly forgettable name but promises to remember everything you throw at it. This $1,500 laptop is one of the first entry-level notebooks with two hard drives for extra storage or automatic backup.</p>
        <p>The laptop has two gigabytes of memory and an Intel Core 2 Duo processor running at 1.66 gigahertz. The two 120-gigabyte hard drives can be configured in three ways: they can be used separately; both can be chained together to create one large drive; or one can be used to back up the other.</p>

        <p>The 15.4-inch screen has a resolution of 1,280 by 800 pixels and includes a Mobile Intel graphics chipset along with a DVD writer, four U.S.B. ports, a FireWire port and a microphone. The laptop runs Windows Vista Ultimate -- the most advanced version of Microsoft's new operating system -- and has a 5-in-1 media card adapter.</p>
        <p>If 240 gigabytes of hard drive space sounds like too much to carry around with you, remember that just a few years ago a 40-megabyte hard drive was a monster.</p>
