        <p>Less than three months after state voters defeated a proposal that would have outlawed most abortions, legislators introduced a scaled-back version. Unlike its predecessor, the new proposal provides exceptions for abortions in cases when the woman's health or life is at risk or when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. The bill would also require physicians who wish to perform an abortion for health reasons to get another doctor to verify that the woman's health was at risk.</p>
