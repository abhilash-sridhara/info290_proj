      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Bush administration yesterday proposed legislation that would reduce payments to farmers by $10 billion over the next five years and cut off support for wealthy ones entirely.</p>
        <p>The measure, which would succeed a five-year agricultural authorization expiring at the end of this year, was described by some critics of current policy as perhaps the most reform-minded farm bill in decades.</p>
        <p>If approved by Congress, it would also reduce some trade-distorting payments that have gotten the United States into trouble with the World Trade Organization, and might put pressure on the European Union to reduce its own farm subsidies, steps that could restart stalled global trade talks.</p>
        <p>But aspects of the plan, especially the proposal to cut off payments to farmers earning more than $200,000 a year, are already rankling some farm groups. Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, said farmers would have ''serious concerns'' about that provision.</p>
        <p>''You have to get a bigger economy of scale these days to make it in farming,'' Ms. Thatcher said. ''We are all for small farmers, but we are also for what makes economic sense.''</p>
        <p>She said the federation's figures showed that the provision would affect 75,000 of the 700,000 farmers who have been collecting farm payments.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Washington, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said the reduction in overall spending, to $87.8 billion over five years, reflected the administration's need to tighten the federal budget.</p>
        <p>But the Agriculture Department was able to propose billions in increased spending on some programs because of expectations that prices for commodities like corn, soybeans and wheat would be much higher. That would reduce farm subsidies.</p>
        <p>The proposal would increase conservation financing, for instance, by $7.8 billion and direct almost $5 billion to fruit, vegetable and other ''specialty'' growers, who have received little federal assistance in the past. It would also provide $1.6 billion for research and development on cellulosic ethanol, which comes from agricultural waste and nonfood crops.</p>
        <p>The proposal would actually increase overall direct payments to farmers by $5.5 billion, or 10 percent, over 10 years.</p>
        <p>But it would also reduce large loans that, Brazil and other countries have argued, distort global trade. The United States is already under pressure to respond to Brazil's successful challenge at the World Trade Organization to the American cotton program.</p>
        <p>In addition, the proposal would save $3.7 billion over 10 years by adjusting cyclical payments that have been based on low commodity prices. Under the legislation, the payments would be based instead on low yields per acre, a system that could aid drought-afflicted farmers who wind up with little revenue.</p>
        <p>The department noted that under the government's current policies, only 9 percent of all American farms collected 54 percent of all government commodity payments.</p>
        <p>One critic of those policies, Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said that ''Secretary Johanns has really planted a flag for reform.'' Mr. Cook, who in pushing conservation has long been on the attack against federal subsidies to large farmers, said the measure was ''the most detailed proposal I have seen in the 30 years I have been working on agriculture issues.''</p>
        <p>Other groups, including the antipoverty organization Oxfam America, also praised the bill for seeking to cut off the richest growers while emphasizing support for beginning and poor farmers.</p>
        <p>But the department faces a tough fight in Congress this spring, with an especially stiff challenge to the provision eliminating payments to wealthy producers. Under the proposal, subsidies would go only to growers who make less than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, a restriction affecting 71,800 farmers of the two million who declared farm income in 2003.</p>
        <p>The current income cap is far more -- $2.5 million -- and it disappears altogether if at least 75 percent of a grower's income is farm-related.</p>
        <p>Europe has failed in its efforts to cap farm payments according to income. The European Commission proposed such limits in 2002 but withdrew the proposal when Germany and Britain indicated that they would not support it.</p>
