        <p>A study of more than 5,500 leaders in Conservative Judaism found that about two-thirds of the movement's rabbis, cantors and seminary students in the United States favored the ordination of gay men and lesbians. Support was even higher among educators and lay leaders. The study was commissioned by the Jewish Theological Seminary, based in New York, which is now deciding whether to admit openly gay students. Last December, the movement's law committee adopted three conflicting legal opinions on the issue, one of which opened the door to ordaining gay people.</p>
