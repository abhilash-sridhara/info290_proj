        <p>The Mets left-hander Dave Williams will be out indefinitely after having surgery yesterday to repair a herniated disk in his neck. The team will know more about his future next week after evaluating X-rays. Williams, 27, was among nine pitchers expected to challenge for a spot in the rotation, and he could also pitch in long relief. He went 3-1 with a 5.59 earned run average in six games (five starts) last season after he was acquired from Cincinnati on May 25.</p>
