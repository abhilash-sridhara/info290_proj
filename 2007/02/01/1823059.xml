        <p>Getting a boost from ''American Idol,'' Fox's ''House,'' starring Hugh Laurie, below, posted its highest ratings ever Tuesday, drawing 27.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates. Among adults 18 to 49, the 9 p.m. episode of ''House'' had the best ratings of any scripted show on any network in nearly a year, and no other hour of drama on Fox has delivered more viewers in more than 10 years. Fox commanded the night as ''American Idol'' remained up over a year ago with 33.3 million viewers at 8. Opposite Fox's programming, NBC, CBS and ABC broadcast mostly reruns. A new installment of ABC's ''Boston Legal'' led at 10 in total viewers (9.4 million), but NBC's ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' repeat (8.3 million) finished on top among the 18-to-49 set. In January's cable news race, MSNBC continued narrowing the gap with CNN in prime time; Fox News has been No. 1 for five consecutive years. Among adults 25 to 54, MSNBC was up 45 percent compared with last January (to 217,000 from 150,000), while CNN had a 29 percent increase (to 260,000 from 202,000). Fox News improved 22 percent (to 389,000 from 319,000), remaining especially dominant in total viewers (1.6 million) compared with CNN (809,000) and MSNBC (530,000).</p>
