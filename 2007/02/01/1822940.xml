        <p>Hong Kong is poised to hold the first election in more than half a century that includes a democracy advocate seeking high office in territory controlled by the Chinese government in Beijing.</p>
        <p>A pro-democracy politician, Alan Leong, announced Wednesday that he had obtained enough nominations to appear on the ballot to become the territory's next chief executive. But he acknowledged that he had no chance of beating the Beijing-backed incumbent, Donald Tsang, who is seeking re-election.</p>

        <p>Hong Kong is poised to hold the first election in more than half a century that includes a democracy advocate seeking high office in territory controlled by the Chinese government in Beijing.</p>
        <p>A pro-democracy politician, Alan Leong, announced Wednesday that he had obtained enough nominations to appear on the ballot to become the territory's next chief executive. But he acknowledged that he had no chance of beating the Beijing-backed incumbent, Donald Tsang, who is seeking re-election.</p>
        <p>Under electoral rules imposed by Chinese officials, only 796 people on the election committee -- the bulk of them with close ties to mainland China -- will be allowed to vote in the March 25 election. It will be the first contested election for chief executive since Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsang, an able administrator who took office during the early stages of a sharp economic upturn in 2005, is popular with the general public. Polls consistently indicate that three-fifths of Hong Kong's people approve of the job he has been doing.</p>
        <p>''It is of course a foregone conclusion -- Donald Tsang will be elected and will hold office for another five years,'' said Mr. Leong, the former chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association.</p>
        <p>The election rules require at least 100 of the 796 electors to nominate a candidate. The electors must make their nominations public, which has made it possible until now for Beijing officials and their allies to discourage electors from nominating advocates of greater democracy.</p>
        <p>Almost half the electors are automatically allowed to cast ballots because they belong to Beijing-controlled groups or hold other posts, like membership in the National People's Congress in Beijing. But professionals like accountants and teachers and lawyers elect most of the rest.</p>
        <p>Democracy advocates were unexpectedly successful last month in persuading members of these professions to choose electors willing to stand up to pressure from Beijing and nominate Mr. Leong, who supports the introduction of universal suffrage here. Out of seven million people in Hong Kong, about 200,000 were eligible to vote for electors last month, and 56,000 did so.</p>
        <p>The vote on March 25 will be a secret ballot. Mr. Leong said that some electors had told him they privately agreed with his stance that the rule of law and the independence of the civil service had been eroded and politicized by the current government.</p>
        <p>Those electors may be willing to support him in a secret ballot but refuse to participate in nominating him, Mr. Leong said. He added, ''The system is the system -- you can't be too hard on them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsang has been silent about his plans, but has scheduled a news conference for Thursday to open his well-financed campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leong, who is better known among lawyers than he is among the broader public, emerged as the democratic camp's champion after two better-known candidates decided not to run: Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, and Anson Chan, who was Mr. Tsang's highly popular predecessor as chief secretary, the second highest position here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leong, 48, said that since he began campaigning for nominations, he had been asked ''four or five times'' by Hong Kong residents where they should vote for him. He had been forced to tell each of them that they did not have a vote.</p>
        <p>''I would count these questions as an achievement in the last three months,'' he said. ''We want the people in Hong Kong to really feel the unfairness.''</p>
