        <p>Rijksmuseum Reopening Delayed  The reopening of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam after renovations has been postponed until 2010, two years later than planned, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. ''The delay is caused by the time needed to obtain the necessary permits following modification of the plans for the study center,'' the Dutch Culture Ministry said. The ministry said 80 new permits were needed. Last March the reopening of the museum was postponed to 2009 from 2008 to allow time for an environmental impact study of the renovations.</p>
        <p>Pamuk Cancels Trip to Germany  Orhan Pamuk of Turkey, the 2006 Nobel laureate in literature, has canceled a trip to Germany, but his publisher declined to confirm a newspaper report that Mr. Pamuk, right, feared he might be assassinated, Agence France-Press reported yesterday. The newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger said Mr. Pamuk believed he might be killed, as was Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor gunned down in Istanbul on Jan. 19. Like Mr. Pamuk he had challenged the official Turkish version of the 1915 Armenian genocide. Mr. Pamuk's German publisher, Hanser, gave no reason for the cancellation of his visit, which was to have taken him to the Free University in Berlin for an honorary doctorate before lectures in Hamburg, Cologne and Munich. A spokesman for the German interior ministry said the government had no information on any threat to Mr. Pamuk.</p>
        <p>Dallas Symphony Chooses Music Director  Jaap van Zweden has been named the music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra for four years beginning in September 2008. He will retain his posts as music director of the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and the Radio Kamer Filharmonie and principal conductor of the Royal Flemish Philharmonic Orchestra of Belgium. Mr. van Zweden, whose full name is pronounced yap van ZVAY-den, was born in Amsterdam in December 1960, entered the Juilliard School in New York at 16 and was 19 when invited to join the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra as its concertmaster. He began conducting in 1994 and served as chief conductor of the Netherlands Symphony Orchestra from 1996 to 2003. James Conlon's contract as music director of the Ravinia Festival has been extended by four years, through the 2011 season, when he will complete his multiyear traversal of the Mahler symphonies with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the festival announced. Ravinia, in Highland Park, Ill., a Chicago suburb, has been the summer home of the orchestra since 1936.</p>
        <p>French Court Says Yes To 'Misérables' Sequels  France's high court of appeals has upheld the right to publish two books marketed as sequels to the Victor Hugo classic ''Les Misérables.'' Pierre Hugo, the author's great-great-grandson, had previously won symbolic damages of $1.30 for breach of ''moral rights'' from the publishing company Plon in Paris. It had issued ''Cosette'' and ''Marius,'' two novels by François Cérésa that depicted the lives of leading characters after the ending of ''Les Misérables'' and even resurrected Javert, the police inspector who drowns in the Seine. In a decision on Tuesday the Cour de Cassation overturned the lower court ruling, which had been seen as an important test case on copyright, saying its decision had failed to establish how the new books damaged Hugo's work and adding that the ruling was ''a violation of the intellectual property code.''</p>
        <p>French Seize Malian Relics  French customs officials in Paris have seized a collection of ancient art and tools from Mali, above, some possibly as much as a million years old, Reuters reported. Sophie Hocquerelle, a spokeswoman for the customs office, said yesterday that the objects, including 601 stone hand axes and tools, as well as 68 bracelets and necklaces, arrived from Bamako, Mali's capital, as air cargo labeled handicrafts. She said they were bound for Los Angeles, where private buyers might have been waiting.</p>
        <p>Eagles at Work  Don Henley, a founding member of the rock group the Eagles, says the band is nearing completion of its first album of all-new music in 28 years, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. ''It's coming out in 60 to 90 days, if we don't kill each other first,'' he told the crowd at a private concert at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Billy Joel, who will sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl on Sunday, is releasing his first pop single in 14 years, The Associated Press reported. The song, ''All My Life,'' will be available on the People magazine Web site on Feb. 7 and can be downloaded from iTunes on Feb. 20. The song, an anniversary present for his wife, Katie Lee, will be in stores this year.</p>
