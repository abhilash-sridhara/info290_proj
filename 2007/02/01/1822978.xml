        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Closing the Revolving Door'' (editorial, Jan. 25):</p>
        <p>In New York City's jails, ''discharge planning'' -- helping incarcerated people prepare to re-enter the community -- can reduce recidivism rates.</p>
        <p>This year, we will spend $11 million in public and private funds on strategies to make it less likely that people leaving our jails will return.</p>
        <p>We work with the Department of Homeless Services to identify and help people who bounce between jail and shelters. Eligible inmates can now enroll for Medicaid and obtain Social Security cards and birth certificates before leaving Rikers Island.</p>
        <p>And a half-dozen community organizations help them plan for their release, connecting them to after-jail services like employment and drug treatment and even transporting them from jail to services.</p>
        <p>Preliminary results show that nearly two-thirds of the formerly incarcerated who stayed in after-jail programs for 90 days didn't come back in the year after their release.</p>
        <p>Our plan to expand and open community-based jails in Brooklyn and the Bronx will help even more inmates benefit from these supportive discharge programs.</p>
        <p>Martin F. Horn  Commissioner of Correction and Probation  New York, Jan. 26, 2007</p>
