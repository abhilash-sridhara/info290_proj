        <p>Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has opened an investigation into the relationships between lenders and the colleges and universities that steer their students toward them for loans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo has requested and received information from six loan companies, among them Nelnet, Educap and Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, according to lenders and government officials.</p>
        <p>The officials said Mr. Cuomo was also sending letters to more than 50 colleges and universities nationwide, asking them for information on how they select so-called preferred lenders. College financial aid offices compile lists of these lenders to recommend to student borrowers.</p>
        <p>Student loans are a big and growing business -- students took out more than $17 billion in private loans last year, according to the College Board -- and loan companies are numerous. Because students rarely shop around and tend to rely on guidance from a university's financial aid office, getting on the preferred lender list is a major marketing advantage.</p>
        <p>To win a spot on the lists, loan companies use various tactics. The New York Times reported in October that Educap, for example, invited university officials and their spouses to a conference in the Caribbean, all expenses paid. After the publicity, the company canceled the conference, which it said was not about financial aid.</p>
        <p>The officials who spoke about Mr. Cuomo's inquiry, which is a civil investigation, said they did not want to be identified because the letters have not been sent out yet. They said the attorney general would ask the colleges and universities to disclose any financial relationships they may have with loan companies, the terms of loans taken out by students, and any benefits given by loan companies to individual financial aid administrators.</p>
        <p>The letters are not subpoenas but formal requests for information. It is unclear which colleges and universities will receive the letters.</p>
        <p>In similar letters sent by Mr. Cuomo to the loan companies, the attorney general's office asked for information, including documents, describing their loan marketing tactics and their relationships with colleges and universities, according to companies that received the letters. Those letters also sought information about requests that colleges and universities make of lenders, according to the companies.</p>
        <p>The attorney general's office has met with representatives of at least some of the loan companies, the government officials said.</p>
        <p>Tom Joyce, a spokesman for Sallie Mae, said, ''We're answering their questions, and we look forward to cooperating.''</p>
        <p>Ben Kiser, a spokesman for Nelnet, a large student loan company, said it would also cooperate. ''We do view this as an opportunity to talk about the services that we provide,'' he said.</p>
        <p>An official at Educap declined to comment. Calls to Education Finance Partners, another company that the officials said received a letter, were not returned. Education Finance in some cases pays colleges an amount based on how much students borrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo's predecessor as attorney general, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, made his name with aggressive investigations involving large Wall Street firms and powerful corporations. Looking at student loan companies puts Mr. Cuomo in sync with Democrats in Washington who have made college affordability a party issue.</p>
        <p>''He's following the Spitzer paradigm,'' Douglas Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College in New York, said of Mr. Cuomo. Investigating student loans also has ''a narrative that's clearly understood; it's national.''</p>
        <p>If the attorney general's office is to exercise jurisdiction over a loan company or a college or university outside New York, there would have to be some connection to the state.</p>
        <p>''If they're marketing or sending solicitations to people in New York, then the attorney general has jurisdiction,'' said Dee Pridgen, a law professor at the University of Wyoming who has studied consumer protection law. ''In a sense, they're doing business in New York.''</p>
        <p>Loan companies' tactics to get on preferred lender lists, in addition to paying cash back to colleges based on the amount that students borrow, include providing money that universities can use to make loans to students with poor credit, the more loans other students take out. One company helped install costly software systems for managing student loan applications in financial aid offices, free of charge.</p>
        <p>Some financial aid administrators say there are good reasons for students to use a preferred lender list, because without them, students must rely on direct marketing materials from loan companies.</p>
        <p>''Most students don't know enough about it,'' said Pamela W. Fowler, director of financial aid at the University of Michigan, which does not use a preferred lender list. ''And they don't take time to read anything we send them.''</p>
