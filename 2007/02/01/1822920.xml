        <p>Q. Centranthus ruber sounds like my ideal perennial: tough, adaptable and long-blooming. But I have had trouble finding it at nurseries. Seems to me it should be as common as coreopsis. Am I missing something?</p>
        <p>A. Gardeners are attracted to Centranthus ruber, a k a Jupiter's beard or red valerian, for just the merits you mention. Bees and butterflies flock to it too, drawn by the spurred red flowers.</p>

        <p>A Perennial With Good P.R.</p>
        <p>Q. Centranthus ruber sounds like my ideal perennial: tough, adaptable and long-blooming. But I have had trouble finding it at nurseries. Seems to me it should be as common as coreopsis. Am I missing something?</p>
        <p>A. Gardeners are attracted to Centranthus ruber, a k a Jupiter's beard or red valerian, for just the merits you mention. Bees and butterflies flock to it too, drawn by the spurred red flowers.</p>
        <p>But the more enthusiastic descriptions do sometimes omit a few useful details.</p>
        <p>Most important is this plant's preference for well-drained, slightly alkaline soil. Centranthus will grow briefly almost anywhere. But brief is the operative word in wet or acid conditions, particularly in Zone 5, the northern edge of its range.</p>
        <p>Also, the color is odd. In species plants the red is a pinkish brick, not unattractive in itself but frequently failing to play well with others.</p>
        <p>And then there is fragrance. Like the medicinal herb valerian (Valeriana officinalis), to which it is distantly related, C. ruber smells like vanilla to many, but some find cat urine a closer analogy.</p>
        <p>For best results, choose the clearer red C. ruber Coccineus or the white C. ruber Albus. Plant away from sitting areas, in full sun, in fast-draining soil. Cut back often to promote bushy growth and rebloom and prevent invasive self-seeding.</p>

        <p>Red Doesn't Mean Dead</p>
        <p>Q. The ivy under the trees in my terrace planters turns red each fall, forcing me to replant each spring. Yet I see green winter ivy all over town. What am I doing wrong?</p>
        <p>A. If the ivy's only problem is that it turns red in fall, the only thing you are doing wrong is assuming that means it has died. Many varieties of English ivy (Hedera helix) turn red or purple in temperatures below 40 degrees. Ivy that enjoyed summer shade often turns red in winter sun, especially if the site is windy.</p>
        <p>This spring, wait a while before replanting. As the weather warms and the trees start providing shade, the ivy will probably make new leaves, and those leaves will be green.</p>
