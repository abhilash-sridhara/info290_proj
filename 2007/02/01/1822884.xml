        <p>ORANGE--Michael M.D. died peacefully on January 28th at St. Marys Hospital in North Palm Beach, Florida. He is survived by his loving Wife Ruth, devoted daughters, Jan Orange and Jeri Cohen, his sons-in-law, Ira Podlofsky and Sanford Cohen, his adoring grandchildren, Zachary and Alexandra Cohen, and Jessica and David Podlofsky, and his beloved brother-in-law and sister-in-law Alan and Elizabeth Shulman. Dr. Orange, a Pediatrician on Long Island, was a role model for all of his patients. He possessed a brilliant mind and had a compassionate and caring character. A member of North Shore Hospital since its inception, Dr. Orange will be missed by all those he touched. In addition to his private practice, Dr. Orange was a Supervisor of School Health for the Bureau of Queens in New York City. He worked diligently for the welfare of those in need in the school system and was highly regarded by the entire school health department, for his expertise. Early in his career, Dr. Orange developed a method for determining the amount of magnesium in an infants body. This method known as the Orange Method received World Wide acclaim. Michael Orange was a kind and generous soul, and he was our Gentle Giant, who will always remain in our Hearts. A Memorial Service and internment will be at Menorah Gardens in North Palm Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, January 31st, at 2:30 pm. Shiva will be observed at 24 Mineola Avenue, Roslyn, NY on Saturday Evening, Sunday and Monday.</p>
