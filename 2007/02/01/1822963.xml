        <p>The House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a $463.5 billion measure to keep the federal government running until Oct. 1, making about $10 billion in token adjustments to last year's spending levels to increase financing for education grants, scientific research and international health programs.</p>
        <p>The legislation is a stopgap to stand in for the many spending bills for the 2007 fiscal year that the previous Congress did not pass. The bill essentially continues a previous measure that paid for the government's work until Feb. 15. The House passed the bill 286 to 140, with 57 Republicans joining 229 Democrats to support it. The Senate is expected to take it up next week.</p>
        <p>The bill was notable for its treatment of earmarks -- the thousands of pet projects that individual lawmakers often tuck into complicated spending bills. Such items have come under fire as prone to waste, cronyism and corruption, and the new Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate appropriations committees declared a moratorium on earmarks for the stopgap-spending bill.</p>
        <p>In fact, the chairmen were making the best of their situation. Republicans, who controlled the House for the last dozen years, had already passed defense and domestic security spending bills and set the overall budget parameters for fiscal 2007. Without time to pass full spending bills for both the remainder of this year and the next one, the Democrats chose to pass what is known as a continuing resolution -- a comparatively brief bill that roughly preserves current spending levels. Such resolutions by their nature do not contain earmarks or any other detailed spending instructions for specific departments.</p>
        <p>The Democrats never promised to cut the financing for existing earmarks, and even without specific instructions, executive agencies are expected to keep allocating money to the pet projects that the same lawmakers include each year. As a result, the effect of the continuing resolution is not to wipe out existing earmarks but to make it harder for lawmakers to insert new ones.</p>
        <p>House Republicans attacked the Democrats for failing to do more to strike out continuing earmarks. Republican leaders proposed a countermeasure that they said would have eliminated many such items, citing as an example $44 million in still-unused money that was set aside for an indoor rain forest in Iowa.</p>
        <p>''Democrats promised this massive spending bill would be earmark-free, but then gave us a bill that includes hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funding for earmarked pork projects,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader.</p>
        <p>But Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, blamed the Republicans for failing to complete the 2007 spending bills, and for allowing the insertion of earmarks like the Iowa rain forest in the first place.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to clean up their spilt milk,'' Mr. Obey said. He told Republicans, ''We had no requirement to retroactively go back two years earlier and repeal silly things that your side of the aisle did two years ago.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats did make some adjustments within the Republican budget framework they inherited. Democrats said they found $10 billion by dipping into military base-closing funds and taking back other money that federal agencies did not spend for various reasons.</p>
        <p>With that money, they added about $1.2 billion for educational programs, including a $615.4 million increase for Pell Grants that will increase the maximum grant per student by $260 to $4,310.</p>
        <p>The Democratic bill also adds $3.6 billion for veterans' health care and $1.2 billion for military health care; $1.5 billion for various science and research programs including the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation; and about $1.4 billion for international programs to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p>
