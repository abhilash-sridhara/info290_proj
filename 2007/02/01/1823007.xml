        <p>The budget Gov. Eliot Spitzer laid out yesterday represents the first stages of an ambitious health care agenda, including covering hundreds of thousands of uninsured people with government health plans, and broadly revising how Medicaid money is distributed.</p>
        <p>It also contains the seeds of an epic battle -- $1.2 billion a year in cuts -- that could make everything else he wants harder to attain. The proposed cuts, mostly in Medicaid, the health plan for the poor, pit the governor against the Legislature, health care workers and the hospital industry -- powerful camps that welcome some of his ideas, but that fiercely protect their share of Medicaid spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer proposed setting the nation's most generous boundaries for state-subsidized children's health insurance. He would raise the income ceiling for families to cover children, at little cost, through Child Health Plus, to about $82,000 from about $51,000.</p>
        <p>That would make affordable insurance available to nearly all of New York State's 400,000 uninsured children, his administration says. In addition, Mr. Spitzer called for simpler rules for renewing Medicaid coverage, which his assistants said would increase enrollment by 100,000, by keeping eligible people from dropping out.</p>
        <p>For now, the attention is on proposed cuts that would reduce hospitals' overall income by about 1 percent, a significant hit for a money-losing industry that may face other cuts from Washington. But New York has the nation's largest Medicaid program by far, at $46.5 billion, and the governor's proposals would merely restrain its growth to $1.1 billion during the next year.</p>
        <p>''The most significant piece of the budget, the one program that's become, and rightly so, the evidence of spiraling and unwieldy spending, is our Medicaid system,'' Mr. Spitzer said.</p>
        <p>But the governor and members of his staff say they are after something more subtle and audacious than cost-cutting. The goal, they say, is to make Medicaid make sense -- starting with revising old financing formulas that no longer reflect reality.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Spitzer said, the state will make Medicaid more uniform and efficient by taking over local government's role in running it, and it will conduct a top-to-bottom review of what Medicaid pays for each service, adjusting prices to correct shortages of some services and gluts of others.</p>
        <p>None of that consoles 1199 S.E.I.U. United Health Care Workers East, the main hospital and nursing home workers' union, or the Greater New York Hospital Association. They praised some of the governor's plans, but said that his cuts would do real harm.</p>
        <p>''We're basically at break-even, so this cuts into operations,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the hospital group.</p>
        <p>Former Gov. George E. Pataki proposed similar cuts year after year, usually unsuccessfully, and eventually they came to be seen as mere opening bids in budget talks. But 1199 and the industry have reacted heatedly to Mr. Spitzer's plans, protesting that he has not met with them, and objecting to his spoiling-for-a-fight tone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer has publicly blamed the union and hospitals t for out-of-control spending. Yesterday, he talked about institutions that,''through a combination of persuasive argument, political strength and effective presence here in Albany,'' drive state spending.</p>
        <p>Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, called that ''an attack on each and every one of 600,000 health care workers in New York State.'' He and Mr. Raske control a rich political action fund that can be used to finance attacks against politicians, but they have not yet threatened to go that route.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera noted that the union and the industry recently accepted a state plan to close and merge a number of hospitals. ''After doing that, to turn around and attack us as entrenched interest groups'' is unfair, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer proposed a one-year freeze on Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes, eliminating an expected increase worth $182 million.</p>
        <p>In other areas, he would cut the money and rearrange it, creating a set of winners and losers that Mr. Raske and his group are still sorting out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer would end the practice of paying hospitals to train young doctors, paying each hospital based in part on how many doctors a hospital had in 1981, even if the number has declined sharply. He proposed cutting $96 million from that program, about 6 percent of the total.</p>
        <p>He called for a $40 million reduction in money to boost the salaries of low-wage workers -- many of them 1199 members -- and train them for new jobs. And again, he would rearrange the money, to favor hospitals that treat mostly Medicaid patients.</p>
        <p>Other proposals would not directly affect the hospital industry, like tighter restrictions on which drugs Medicaid patients get, for a savings of more than $200 million, and more aggressive antifraud measures.</p>
