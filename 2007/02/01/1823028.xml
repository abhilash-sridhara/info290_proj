        <p>First, a Long Island couple used a popular online dating site to find people going through divorces and arranged to have consensual sexual encounters with them, the authorities said yesterday. Then they secretly videotaped the encounters and blackmailed the victims.</p>
        <p>The couple -- Michael Largue, 45, of Franklin Square, and Shawn Payne, 34, of East Hampton -- met victims on AdultFriendFinder.com, according to Nassau County Police officials.</p>
        <p>The couple are charged with trolling the site over the past two years -- he under the screen name Mr. Nice and she simply as Gina -- and seducing, videotaping and then extorting money from possibly dozens of victims, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Largue lured women into sexual relationships, while Ms. Payne videotaped them. They switched roles when Ms. Payne seduced men. After the sexual encounters, the couple threatened to show the taped trysts to relatives, officials said.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the defendants could not be reached yesterday. A spokeswoman for the Nassau County district attorney, Kathleen Rice, said Legal Aid was most likely representing them, but officials there had no immediate information.</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone last night, Mr. Largue's father, Charles Largue, said he had been advised not to talk to reporters.</p>
        <p>''He takes care of his father, that's all I can say,'' the father said. ''I'm sorry, but I've been besieged by reporters today. This is the worst day of my life.''</p>
        <p>AdultFriendFinder.com, a Web site devoted to ''helping people hook up in cyberspace,'' shows photographs of scantily clad men and women, along with the slogan ''Join the world's largest sex and swinger personals community.''</p>
        <p>Members post detailed profiles and write personal blogs, allowing users to screen one another, correspond by e-mail and then meet if they choose. Mr. Largue and Ms. Payne homed in on members who mentioned being in divorce proceedings, the police said.</p>
        <p>On the site, Ms. Payne recently met a 43-year-old Long Island man, the police said. They discussed his impending divorce proceedings and had sexual encounters, which were secretly taped, possibly by Mr. Largue.</p>
        <p>''She told him the tapes would definitely cause him a lot of embarrassment and compromise his divorce proceedings,'' said Sgt. Anthony Repalone, a Nassau police spokesman. ''She basically said, 'I'm going to expose you unless you give me money.' ''</p>
        <p>The couple's scheme was discovered on Sunday when the Long Island man told the police about the relationship, saying he was being blackmailed. Nassau County detectives then set up a sting operation and arrested Ms. Payne after she was seen taking a payment from the man.</p>
        <p>Officers then contacted a 47-year-old woman from upstate New York whose information they had retrieved from Ms. Payne. The woman said she was being extorted after having sex with Mr. Largue, whom she met online, and telling him about her divorce proceedings.</p>
        <p>The woman was concerned about losing her assets in the divorce, the police said, and Mr. Largue introduced her to Ms. Payne, saying she was a financial adviser. They persuaded her to transfer roughly $51,000 into an account in a Long Island bank, then threatened her, the police said.</p>
        <p>''They told her, 'We have a videotape of you having sex with Michael, and if you don't give us the money, we're going to expose you to your family,' '' Sergeant Repalone said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Payne used the same threat to push the woman into prostitution, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said that in Mr. Largue's basement apartment, they found photographs and videotapes of sexual encounters with other people going back roughly two years.</p>
        <p>The spokeswoman for the district attorney's office said Mr. Largue was arraigned yesterday in Nassau County on charges including two counts of grand larceny and was being held in bail of $100,000 bond or $50,000 cash.</p>
        <p>Ms. Payne was arraigned on Tuesday on charges including grand larceny, promoting prostitution and scheming to defraud and was being held in $20,000 bond or 10,000 cash, the spokeswoman said.</p>
