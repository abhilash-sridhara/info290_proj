        <p>CRAIGSLIST has taken on many giants. Can it survive a challenge from Microsoft?</p>
        <p>The software behemoth late last month started Windows Live Expo (expo.live.com), another node in its growing network of Internet services, and a direct stab at Craiglist's vital organs: free, local classified ads.</p>
        <p>In doing so, Microsoft is treading on ground that has swallowed many other companies, and one that Google has also recently begun to explore. But Microsoft is taking a more comprehensive approach than others, using its instant messaging, mapping and blogging services to help people sell items among groups of local friends and acquaintances.</p>
        <p>Craigslist has no such weapons in its arsenal, but it is expanding quickly from its San Francisco base into new markets, making it harder for competitors to generate enough classified listings to attract an audience. Whether it is establishing a defensible position quickly enough, though, is an open question.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be tough for anyone to compete with Craigslist in the Bay area,'' said Charlene Li, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''But I think it's still wide open in many other places.''</p>
        <p>At first glance, Expo looks like countless other Craigslist pretenders, with a list of categories on the home page, which users can localize by ZIP code or city. Users may also search for specific items. When users post new listings, they are asked to tag their listing by ZIP code, and they may also include their exact address for advertising garage sales or for listing real estate for sale or rent. Then, when prospective customers click on the ad, they can see a satellite image of the home.</p>
        <p>More important, perhaps, is the feature that allows Expo users to choose to view only listings from people in their MSN Messenger contact list or personal e-mail groups. MSN Messenger users will see a pulsating star next to the name of anyone on their list who has recently placed a new item for sale on Expo or made a new posting on MSN Spaces, Microsoft's popular blogging service.</p>
        <p>With 205 million people signed up as Messenger users, and another 40 million users of MSN Spaces (and 100 million Spaces visitors in the last 16 months), the company already has a strong network of potential classifieds customers, said Garry Wiseman, Microsoft's product unit manager for Windows Live Expo.</p>
        <p>''I've seen some sites attempt to create these kinds of services, but they have to build it up, which takes forever,'' Mr. Wiseman said. ''We already had this massive network.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiseman said Microsoft would not charge for classified listings in the short term, but might charge businesses to post job or auto listings, as Craigslist does. He also said Microsoft was exploring a way to distribute the ads in print publications owned by other companies, and share in the revenue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Li, the Forrester analyst, said Microsoft was wise to use the array of services within Windows Live to help users sell goods and services more easily. ''It's a fantastic idea,'' she said. ''People love eBay so much because it's about community. Expo has the potential to have it, whereas classifieds don't have that soul.''</p>
        <p>Fans of Craigslist -- many of whom bare their most intimate thoughts on the site's discussion boards -- would disagree, and perhaps reel at the notion of Microsoft having more soul than their beloved, humble servant of a Web site, with its staff of 19.</p>
        <p>Whatever the label, Microsoft may find that the wheels of commerce will roll more even quickly among people who are more closely connected than the like-minded strangers who congregate on Craigslist.</p>
        <p>Of course, Microsoft's idea has been tried before, back when Friendster was the future star du jour. Tribe.net, a social networking site, received backing from three major newspaper chains in 2003 on the logic that it might help them win back some of the classified advertising revenue that has migrated online in recent years.</p>
        <p>But social networking sites have so far failed to generate nearly as many classified advertising listings as Craigslist, analysts said, partly because users have seen those sites more as places to hook up for romance or friendship than for local commerce -- an area Craigslist has increasingly ruled in the last year.</p>
        <p>Just as eBay has built a sizable lead against competing services because it has exponentially more merchandise to offer, so too has Craigslist become a go-to site for anyone looking for housing and other products and services in markets like San Francisco and New York. Likewise, sellers now flock to the site in those markets because that's where the buyers are.</p>
        <p>According to comScore Networks, an online consultant, 8.5 million people visited a Craigslist Web site in February, up from 3.7 million a year earlier. The closest competitor was the Trader Publishing Company, a Norfolk, Va.-based publisher of classified ad magazines and Web sites largely devoted to certain categories of goods, like boats, automobiles and luxury homes. Tribe, meanwhile, attracted 740,000 users. The stakes are high for the category winner. Forrester predicts that online classifieds will generate $3.1 billion in sales this year -- a 17 percent jump from last year -- and will reach $4.7 billion by 2010. Newspaper classifieds, by contrast, will reach about $15 billion, up just 5 percent from last year.</p>
        <p>Craigslist, which is privately held, does not disclose revenue. Its growth has come from its expansion into new locations -- as of last week, it had 205 sites covering cities in every state, as well as cities in 35 foreign nations.</p>
        <p>Jim Buckmaster, the chief executive of Craigslist, said the company was concentrating more on starting multilingual sites than other features or services.</p>
        <p>''We can't match them resource for resource, even if we were so inclined,'' Mr. Buckmaster said of his competitors. ''But we don't try to match them in technology bells and whistles, since that's not the kind of thing our users request.''</p>
        <p>Craigslist has, Mr. Buckmaster said, sustained its growth rate despite Google's recent introduction of Base, which many people have used to post classified ads (Base's numbers, which Google would not disclose, are still small enough not to register on commonly used Internet statistics), and the introduction in foreign cities of classified sites by eBay's Kijiji unit. (Ebay own a 25 percent stake in Craigslist). ''The need for this kind of service is so vast that many companies can address it together,'' he said. ''I don't think it has to be a zero sum game.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Buckmaster suggests he could be wrong.</p>
        <p>''Now at least we'll get to see whether our philosophy and way of running things is as important as we think it is,'' he said. ''Who knows? Maybe incremental technological bells and whistles mean a lot. But the experiment has begun.''</p>
