        <p>A big trial starts in federal court here on Monday, involving some very prominent executives who used to work for a very prominent company. Across the country, people will be following the case with great interest.</p>
        <p>But in Houston, many residents prefer to focus on other things, like the resurgent economy, and city leaders wish outsiders would, too. The company, of course, is Enron, and the men who will be on trial are its former top executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, who face various charges in the scandal that led to the company's collapse and tarred this city's reputation four years ago.</p>
        <p>''As of today, it's as if Enron had never happened,'' said Joan Johnson, president of the Hotel and Lodging Association of Greater Houston, echoing the sentiment of many Houstonians. Ms. Johnson said hotel occupancy was high, even though about 3,000 hotel rooms had been added downtown since Enron's collapse.</p>
        <p>But as jury selection starts on Monday, residents here will have to relive the Enron debacle, with the possibility that the trial will drag on over several months. Already, hotels near the federal courthouse have been receiving a flow of out-of-town journalists, perhaps adding to the strength of the city's lodging industry.</p>
        <p>In preparation for the trial, city officials are trying to accentuate the positive. The Greater Houston Partnership, a business association, raised the idea of coaching bellhops and other hotel workers on how to put Houston's best face forward in the downtown hotels, where many journalists will be staying. It rejected the proposal and instead backed a plan to post media contacts and Internet links in hotel lobbies, with the aim of planting ideas for positive stories.</p>
        <p>Have you heard, for example, that Bakersfield, Calif., has unhealthier air quality than Houston, or that Houston has 82 foreign consulates, the nation's third-largest consular corps? The partnership puts those tidbits and more at the disposal of visiting news media.</p>
        <p>''It was devastating for Houston to have its image portrayed as a bunch of corporate gunslingers during the first Enron go-around,'' said John F. Thrash, chief executive of eCorp, a family-owned energy concern, and the husband of Becca Cason Thrash, the hostess of Houston's most extravagant high-society gatherings. ''That is something we're striving to overcome.''</p>
        <p>It isn't just Enron. Some residents get the jitters over even the slightest negative publicity about Houston, its wildcatting business ethic, its no-zoning sprawl or its continuing battles with industrial pollution. This week there was an outcry over an oil-laden, caramel-colored fog that blanketed a poor neighborhood in the shadow of the city's largest refinery.</p>
        <p>Of course, Houston has taken numerous additional hits since Enron's collapse in late 2001, when the symbol of outrage became a question at a company meeting from an anonymous Enron employee to Mr. Lay, the company's embattled chairman: ''Are you on crack?''</p>
        <p>Thousands of well-paid Enron employees lost jobs, and the city's name was associated with schemes to hide losses from investors and destabilize the flow of electricity in California.</p>
        <p>Back then, Houston was also criticized for its freewheeling approach to business. That shows few signs of fading. While not experiencing a boom as incandescent as past expansions, Houston's economy is still growing steadily, driven by inexpensive real estate, climbing energy prices and a fast-growing population.</p>
        <p>"We're fine now, but the impact at the time was huge," said John Flowers, who owns Kenneally's Irish Pub near the exclusive River Oaks neighborhood. He recalls the Enron executives who used to drop by his smoky establishment for pints of Guinness as "free-spending individuals who made more money than God."</p>
        <p>The city's economy has grown for 35 consecutive months, according to a monthly survey of purchasing executives conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Houston. November, the most recent month for which statistics are available, was one of the strongest months in a decade, as demand rose for goods like plastic pipes and refined petroleum products.</p>
        <p>Houston's status as an inland transportation hub with a ship channel to the Gulf of Mexico has also provided a buffer against the demise of Enron. Aided in part by the diversion of cargo from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, revenue at the Port of Houston increased 13 percent last year and total tonnage grew by 9 percent, said H. Thomas Kornegay, executive director of the Port of Houston Authority.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, jobs are being created in the Houston economy. Employers added 42,500 jobs in 2005 and 24,100 in 2004, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. This follows heavy job losses in 2002 and 2003.</p>
        <p>Much of the job creation has been fueled by a growing service industry and a robust construction market expected to expand further this year, even as housing in other parts of the country loses steam amid deflation of the real estate bubble.</p>
        <p>''If any other city lost the seventh-largest corporation in America, it would have had more impact,'' said Tilman J. Fertitta, chief executive of Landry's Restaurants, and one of a handful of Houston businessmen who have filled the void left by Mr. Lay's exit from the city's social scene.</p>
        <p>''It's just a whole hell of a lot cheaper here than other cities,'' Mr. Fertitta, one of the largest holders of real estate in Houston and nearby Galveston, said in an interview. ''This is still an energy town but our prices have allowed us to become more diverse than in the 80's.''</p>
        <p>Relatively low home prices, with three-bedroom homes still widely available for less than $200,000, are luring developers to erect entirely new cities on the prairies and rice fields that make up much of Houston's outer fringe. Cheap land pushed housing starts to a record high in 2005, when they climbed 18 percent, to 48,000, according to Metrostudy, a real estate consulting firm.</p>
        <p>One new real estate venture, a planned community called Bridgeland that is being developed by General Growth Properties of Chicago, is projected to consist of 21,000 new homes over 10,000 acres, an area larger than Houston's entire existing inner core of skyscrapers, subdivisions and shopping districts.</p>
        <p>This project and others are a bet that Houston's population will continue to climb. The Houston-Galveston Area Council, which represents the eight-county Houston area, forecasts an increase to 8.8 million residents by 2035, from 5.3 million today. Much of the growth is driven by immigrants from Latin America, Africa and Asia, who come here legally or illegally and stay for the same reason that 150,000 survivors of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita relocated to Houston last year: a warm welcome.</p>
        <p>In contrast to other communities that have experienced successful movements against illegal immigrants, calls by anti-immigrant groups last year to start questioning residents about their citizenship status drew a chilly response from Mayor Bill White and police officials, who perceived such a measure as a diversion from preventing crime.</p>
        <p>And in a decision that raised eyebrows throughout Texas, The Dallas Morning News on Jan. 1 named Houston its ''2005 Texan of the Year.'' The city beat out the filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, the cyclist Lance Armstrong and Ronnie Earle, the prosecutor who helped engineer the indictment of Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican who represents Houston's southern suburbs.</p>
        <p>In an editorial that seemed a veiled criticism of political divisiveness in its hometown, The Morning News cited Houston's ''resilience, resourcefulness and good old Texas neighborliness on a scale that did the whole state proud.''</p>
        <p>''The mountain came to Mohammed when Dallas tipped its hat at us that way,'' said Richard W. Murray, an influential pollster and political scientist at the University of Houston. ''We've come a long way since the boom 25 years ago, when people were raising cash with projections of $100 oil. No one's doing that now.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Murray pointed out, there is a new sobriety and even, perhaps, the beginning of a sense that the benefits from the city's modest economic expansion need to spread out more equitably. For instance, the Service Employees International Union last month unionized 4,700 janitors in Houston, in one of the most successful unionization drives in the South in recent decades.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the most vibrant area of Houston's economy these days is energy, which is starting to hire after years of job cuts; oil and gas companies account for roughly 50 percent of economic activity here, down from higher levels as other industry grows more prominent.</p>
        <p>So it may be fitting, as Houston tries to put to rest its association with Enron's hard-charging chiefs, that the last of the city's larger-than-life wildcatters are fading away or facing their own legal problems. Red Adair, the oil well firefighter, and Michel T. Halbouty, the geologist who cut his teeth in the east Texas oil fields, both died recently. And federal agents arrested the oilman Oscar S. Wyatt, 81, at his home several weeks ago on charges of paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime.</p>
