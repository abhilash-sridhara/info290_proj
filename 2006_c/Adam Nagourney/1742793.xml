        <p>At a time when considerable political attention is focused on the Democrats' uphill struggle to recapture Congress, leaders of both parties say Democrats appear to be in a much stronger position on another pivotal battlefield this November, the contests for governors.</p>
        <p>Democrats have a strong chance to pick up a number of seats held by Republicans while keeping seats even in states that President Bush won in 2004, potentially allowing Democrats to put their view of government on display across a bigger swath of the country and strengthening their position for the 2008 presidential race, party officials said.</p>

        <p>At a time when considerable political attention is focused on the Democrats' uphill struggle to recapture Congress, leaders of both parties say Democrats appear to be in a much stronger position on another pivotal battlefield this November, the contests for governors.</p>
        <p>Democrats have a strong chance to pick up a number of seats held by Republicans while keeping seats even in states that President Bush won in 2004, potentially allowing Democrats to put their view of government on display across a bigger swath of the country and strengthening their position for the 2008 presidential race, party officials said.</p>
        <p>Among the states that could flip to the Democratic column are Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Ohio, all general election battlegrounds carried by Mr. Bush, as well as New York and perhaps California.</p>
        <p>''From a math standpoint, we've got a tough row to hoe this year,'' Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, the head of the Republican Governors Association, said as the National Governors Association gathered here this weekend for its annual Washington meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romney, whose decision not to seek re-election as he explores a run for president has put his own state in play for Democrats, said Republicans could suffer a net loss of as many as four governorships if the political environment for his party did not improve.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats and independent analysts said the shift could end up being even more pronounced if the problems that have plagued Republicans in Washington continue to mount and Mr. Bush remains politically weakened. They said the furor over a Dubai company's taking over some operations at six American ports had provided them another opportunity to put Republicans on the defensive. They noted that Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. of Maryland, a vulnerable incumbent, was among the first Republicans to step forward to question the deal, which includes the Baltimore port.</p>
        <p>''I think we can pick up between five and seven,'' said Howard Dean, the Democratic national chairman. ''This is going to be a national election if I have anything to do with it: a national referendum on whether you want Republicans to keep running this country and whether you want them to keep running your state.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Duffy, an analyst for The Cook Political Report who tracks national races, said of Democrats, ''If they don't get a majority, they are going to come awfully close.'' The Democrats would need a net gain of four governorships for a majority.</p>
        <p>Beyond the potentially considerable effect on education, health, transportation and other policy issues in the states, the outcome could have substantial implications for the 2008 presidential race. As Mr. Bush showed in Ohio and Florida, having a friendly governor can be critical in close general elections. As a result, this year's contests are of considerable interest to presidential contenders in both parties, many of whom are current or former governors.</p>
        <p>''People underestimate the value of a Republican governor during a presidential cycle,'' said Gov. Mike Huckabee, the Republican governor of Arkansas and a potential presidential candidate. ''It helps a lot.''</p>
        <p>The potential shift is a result of a political map of statehouses that is as challenging to Republicans as the Congressional map is difficult for Democrats. There are 22 Republican governor seats in contention, compared with 14 for Democrats.</p>
        <p>State economies are generally doing well, helping to increase tax revenue, pay for new or expanded programs and provide a positive environment for incumbents. But whatever advantage the economy may hold for Republicans is offset to some degree by term limits, which are forcing many of their incumbents to step aside. Five sitting Republicans, including Jeb Bush in Florida and Mr. Huckabee, are barred from running again, creating open seats. No Democratic governor is facing a term limit this year.</p>
        <p>There are now 28 Republican governors and 22 Democratic. Seven Republicans are not seeking re-election, in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York and Ohio. Only one Democrat is stepping aside: Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who is looking at a run for president.</p>
        <p>''It's not a pretty picture out there,'' said Joe Gaylord, a Republican consultant.</p>
        <p>Democrats do have some of their own problems for November.</p>
        <p>In Pennsylvania, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat seeking a second term, is girding for a prospectively strong challenge from Lynn Swann, the former star football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers. In Michigan, Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, one of the Democrats' most poised candidates, is struggling with a sour economy and facing a well-financed challenge from Richard M. DeVos, a former chairman and co-founder of the Amway Corporation.</p>
        <p>Republicans said they hoped to mount a strong challenge to Gov. James E. Doyle, a Wisconsin Democrat, with Representative Mark Green. To a lesser extent, Democrats said they were concerned about keeping Maine, Oregon and Illinois.</p>
        <p>And the decision by Mr. Vilsack not to seek re-election means Democrats could lose Iowa. ''It's a very tough seat,'' Mr. Vilsack said Saturday. ''The state has only elected seven Democrats in our history.''</p>
        <p>Still, Republicans seem to be in a tougher spot. Analysts said Democrats had a chance of picking up Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, Ohio and -- possibly, though less likely -- Alabama, California, Florida and Minnesota.</p>
        <p>''Massachusetts, Arkansas are really Democratic states, but we have Republican governors,'' Mr. Huckabee said. ''I think we can keep a Republican governor in Arkansas, but it's going to be a challenge.''</p>
        <p>To the frustration of Republican leaders, Democratic governors in states where Mr. Bush won convincingly in 2004 seem to be doing very well, including those in Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming.</p>
        <p>Of all the states in play, the most closely watched is probably Ohio, where Gov. Bob Taft is being forced out by term limits, under a cloud of scandal that has left Republicans fearful of a rout this November. Representative Ted Strickland is the most likely Democratic candidate.</p>
        <p>To the delight of some Democrats, a fierce primary has broken out on the Republican side between J. Kenneth Blackwell, the secretary of state, and Jim Petro, the attorney general.</p>
        <p>''I wish we could have the election yesterday,'' Mr. Strickland said. ''Right now, Democrats are in a superb position in Ohio.''</p>
        <p>Presidential contenders are paying particularly close mind to what is happening in states likely to be at the center of the 2008 presidential race.</p>
        <p>''Governorships are important to the presidential races,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I don't want to overstate that, but I would think it helped in Florida to have the president's brother there.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the head of the Democratic Governors Association and a potential presidential candidate, said: ''People caring about '08 should really care about '06 and the governors' races. Governors are where the future of politics are.''</p>
        <p>For Republicans, the other concern is the potential for the outcome of this year's races to influence the legislative redistricting that will follow the 2010 census, especially if 2006 is the beginning of a resurgence in the national strength of the Democrats. Mr. Gaylord said the 2006 election could be parallel to 1994, when Republicans made national gains that put them in a commanding position when it came time to redraw district lines after the 2000 census.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaylord said one reason Republicans did so well in the 2002 Congressional elections was because of Republican successes in 1994. ''It went so deep at the state and local levels that the Democrats could never turn it back around,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Democratic governors were clearly confident as they confronted the Bush administration on issues including port security, health care and immigration, in what amounted to a map for the campaign ahead.</p>
        <p>Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a Kansas Democrat who is favored in her re-election bid in a state where Mr. Bush won 62 percent of the vote, said ethics and competence would be among the most crucial issues for Democrats in 2006.</p>
        <p>''People demand competence at a bare minimum,'' she said. ''They want to believe that elected officials have their best interests at heart, not special interests.''</p>
